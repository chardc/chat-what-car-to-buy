Welcome to 'Chat, what car to buy?', an AI Chatbot that helps you decide on the best used car for you.

Chat is powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash, a lightweight LLM that combines general knowledge with real crowd wisdom from Reddit. You'll get recommendations and warnings based on lived experiences from real car owners.

Type your question (e.g. "Best used SUV under $10k?" or "What are common problems for a 2012 Civic?") and let Chat handle the research.

Type 'exit' at any time to leave the app.
