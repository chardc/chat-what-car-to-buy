The queries involved location-specific, model-specific, and thematic keywords to ensure that the search covers as much ground as possible. Chosen subreddits have > 1e5 subscribers to ensure that search queries will yield a significant amount of results per API request. These queries and subreddits can be accessed in the paths: `../src/search_queries.txt` and `../src/subreddits.txt`, respectively. \n",

    "The objective is to search and scrape for posts (and child comments) within the specified subreddits using the search queries provided. However, with a 10x10 query and subreddit array, I expect at least an initial 100 requests for the subreddit search yielding 100x100 submissions at most. Fetching the comments involves significantly more requests as each submission requires 1 request to yield the CommentForest. Fetching the comments will require at least 10,000 requests.\n",

I’m after a pre-owned automatic small/compact SUV that is around $20k or less, under 100,000 km, around 5 years old or newer, good fuel economy (for long-distance and highway driving), and higher ground clearance (for occasional gravel/uneven terrain, not off-roading). I’m also looking for a car with features like cruise or adaptive cruise control, Apple CarPlay, reverse camera, rear sensors, and decent safety features.\\n\\nFor context, I’m currently working as an ecologist and sometimes need to travel long distances for field work (e.g. to the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast), so highway efficiency and comfort matter. The car will mostly be used by me and occasionally one passenger, so back seat space isn’t a priority, and a standard-sized boot will be more than enough.\\n\\nRight now, I’m driving a problematic 2010 Audi A3 that I bought from a shady dealer. It has given me a huge headache and I’m often stressed that something bad might happen when I’m on the road. Yes… I know I shouldn’t have bought a pre owned euro car, let alone from a shady dealer… I’ve learnt my lesson :’)\\n\\nSince I don’t know too much about cars, I’m not confident buying privately and will be sticking to dealers (I know the prices will be higher). I’ve heard of big dealers like Cars4Us, Big Box Cars, and Motorama. Are they reliable? If anyone has good experiences (or warnings) about Brisbane dealers, please let me know!\\n\\nSo far, the cars I’ve seen online that fit my criteria are the 2019/2020 Hyundai Kona Go and the 2021 Kia Stonic S YB. I’ve also come across models like the Mitsubishi ASX and Nissan Qashqai within this price range, but I have not done much research on them. I’m mainly looking at Japanese or Korean brands due to their reputation for reliability and lower maintenance costs. At the moment, I’m most drawn to the Hyundai Kona based on its reviews, features and appearance. I know Toyotas and Hondas are usually recommended, but I haven’t found any that meet my criteria and budget (they tend to be older or higher in kms for the same price).\\n\\nI would really appreciate any advice or thoughts whether it’s on the models I’m looking at, other car model recommendations, dealer experiences or any other suggestions.\\n\\nThanks in advance!\\n', \"Hello, I am looking for a car with good fuel economy and cheap servicing.

If you put 91 fuel into a car which requires 95, you’ll get engine “knocking” - in other words,  the fuel detonates \\\\*before\\\\* the engine actually ignites it, which creates a jarring, shuddering effect. However, as cars which take 91 fuel don’t knock on 91 regardless, 95 and 98 won’t help.\\n\\nPutting 95 or 98 into a car which doesn’t need it is like a non-asthmatic taking Ventolin before exercise - it’s just wasting money on something that isn’t actually required.\\n\\nThe one advantage of 95 and 98 fuel in a 91 fuel car isn’t anything to do with reliability - it’s environmental. 91 fuel in Australia has ridiculously high tolerance applied for sulphur content, which leads to awful emissions quality.\\n\\nFor what it’s worth, I am a mechanical engineer, but I don’t specialise in engines.

If you are doing long distance, it's borderline useless in Australia. So many of the chargers don't work properly if it's not a tesla super charger. And there aren't enough superchargers around. I have to plan a lot for a road trip, but generally it's more annoying than prohibitive. \\n- If you don't have home charging, it can be a real problem. But this problem is getting better. \\n- association with Elon and other EV nuts. Most people who drive cars just want a comfortable car, but some of the EVangelists are a bit much. \\n- more expensive to buy for like for like. Ev version of the same brand car is more expensive \\n- high depreciation. Although this may be slightly over stated. \\n- slightly more expensive insurance. \\n- long wait to get fixed if you get into an accident. We waited 4 months for a panel to get fixed.  But we did get a replacement car during that time. \\n- most evs are not quite as fun as a lightweight sports car and obviously no sound. Manual sports are still more fun. \\n\\nPros\\n- charging experience at home is amazing. I don't have a home charger and I just plug it into a normal plug. Get about 200km over night. Not needing to go fuel up is so good.  There is the obvious cost savings of charging at night.\\n- driving experience for commuting is amazing. Quiet, quick, effortless and basics self driving is awesome. \\n- instant torque is addictive. It's very difficult to go back to ice cars after getting used to instant torque. \\n- cheaper than equivalent ice, depending on what you value.  I'd argue for the same power, torque and comfort, you'd have to pay for for an ice car than an EV.  Not many 3 second 0 to 100 ice cars that's under $100k. Not many ice cars offer the same comfort and quietness for the same price. So Evs are simultaneously more expensive and cheaper.  The ora is now under 30k, which is cheaper than most ice cars of the same size. \\n- time saving, money saving and stress saving from the lack of service required. Had 1 service in 4 years and 1 wheel realignment.  Otherwise no issues. My last car was an Audi and that was a disaster even after 1 year. Previous car before that was a corolla and that also had issues over 5 years. Not a single issue with the model 3 so far. \\n- more interior space. EVs have way interior space and interior storage for the same size car. \\n- less break use. I love regen breaking now. It means that how much I press down the accelerator equals what speed I want. It's much more intuitive. \\n- salary packaging. Depending on your tax bracket, this would make EVs significantly cheaper. \\n\\n\\n\\nPersonally if you are mostly using the car for commuting and city driving. EVs are vastly superior.

I believe that time is over and would highly recommend anyone with them to switch to another insurance company. (Do your own research) \\n\\nThe issues I\\'ve personally found with Shannons are the following: \\n\\n\\\\- Lack of \"enthusiasts\" as part of the process:   \\nI recently bought a new car and was looking into getting a quote to add the vehicle to my current policy with Shannons; a limited production, high performance sports car. Firstly I was put off by the curt \"okay\" I received when correcting the person on the phone regarding the engine the car had. I don\\'t know much about insurance, but I imagine there might be issues if the car was noted down as having the wrong engine! \\n\\nSecondly, I was further disappointed when I was told that my \"modern car\" could not be insured for an agreed upon value greater than what I paid for it, even though I got it at a good deal, as the system did not recognize that only 100 of them were ever sold in Australia! What kind of \"enthusiast\" insurance company does not take into account the limited production of a vehicle and only considers the age?   \\n\\n\\n\\\\- Poor policies:  \\nIn regards to their policy conditions, Shannons is behind even Budget Direct.   \\nShannons does not care that the car will be driven maybe 1000km a year, they only note down whether it\\'s driven daily, weekly, fortnightly, etc. Budget recognizes kilometers driven and lowers the price of the policy accordingly. In fact, most of the insurance company\\'s asked me what KM the car would be used for, rather than when it would be. Another strike against Shannons. \\n\\nFurther comparisons revealed that Shannons was more expensive than the average company, that wanted to insure it (disregarding the 6k-7,5k policies I got from QBE and Allianz) and provided less benefits than them. No over 25 excess, free towing, windscreens, etc can all be gotten from other company\\'s on a cheaper policy.   \\n\\n\\n\\\\- Poor value:  \\nA bit of rehash of the above two points, but an important one.   \\nIf you\\'re going to charge more than the competition and provide less benefits, you better provide better value at least...   \\nEnthusiast Insurance, NRMA and Budget Direct all gave me policies that were CHEAPER and provided me with a GREATER value than Shannons. So why would I even continue with Shannons? \\n\\nIn the end I\\'m moving my current car to Enthusiast Insurance and putting my new car on NRMA. Enthusiast won\\'t cover high powered cars for people under 30, but NRMA has great benefits so we\\'ll see what happens when I go to compare in the future.\\n\\nIn summary, the buyout of Shannons seems to have ripped the heart out of the company. They seem to rely on people not shopping around and making money off older people who keep their car garaged and are unlikely to claim. That\\'s fine, Enthusiast Insurance and everyone else does it too, but the cost of the insurance vs the value provided has certainly tipped the scales. \\n\\nIf you have a modified car, I join a lot of car people on reddit and recommend Enthusiast Insurance.   \\nHopefully NRMA is okay.

By all of you, I mean people who actually know, have tried, or own an haval, not people that thought the same of kia and hyundai 10 years ago. Go to this post with open mind and not hate just because it is chinese.\\n\\nBefore I get to my 1 year expierence here's why I bought it. I'm a big car guy since I was a kid and would've never touched a chinese brand in my life, but here I am, 1 year ago, researching haval.\\n\\nAfter the h2, which is a knock off of european cars, they re-created themself into building actual and proper cars. They hired ex german engineers to build the new cars, jolion, h6, tank. The 2022 cars engines are 3-5 years behind modern standards. The 2023 hybrid models are on par with the previous generation toyota engines. Interiors, absolutely no rivals in the price category, build quality, absolutely no rivals in the price category, features, absolutely no rivals in the price category, availability 2 months at max, rivals, more than a year (i wanted a rav 4), warranty, road assistance, capped services. So, after I test drove a sportage, tucson and the seltos, I test drove the jolion and h6. Right out of the gate, you don't see the $10-20k price difference of the other brand. In my opinion, I thought the opposite, the havals should've been $10-20k more. While the h6 has a better snappier engine I chose the jolion as I didn't need a huge car.\\n\\nOrder the car in November 21 and arrived in January 22. Paid $28k for the lux version. When it arrived the price was already up, $30k (it is now $31k). \\n\\nAfter one year and 13.000 kms the review is in and: by far the best purchase I have ever done.\\n\\nPro:\\n- The car drives well in any condition I used it for, urban, trips, holiday.\\n- All the features makes you feel you're driving a modern car. Most of the time it drive itself, I just rest my hands on the sterring wheel. \\n- The engine is more than enough for the speed limits that are in Australia, it drinks a bit but it goes fine.  \\n- Lots of space\\n\\nCons:\\n- it needs setups. You need to go to every single menu and setup all the settings otherwise it is going to beep for anything. \\n- the only problem I had was a faulty battery at 300kms and racv came and replaced it in under 1hr, all included in the road assistance. (The guy said that a lot of them have this fault when they arrive from China.)\\n\\nNow, on the complaints that I read about haval in this subreddit:\\n\\n- Chinese: i feel you, but I don't feel in a chinese car while driving\\n- build quality: for all of you saying it is shit, please go have a test ride\\n- interior build quality and features: same as before, let me know if you find anything even remotely closer below 50k.\\n- Parts: at my service, I requested to swap the blades and they had it. Not sure what happens with big parts if you crash, but also, if you don't live in the bush, you can see how many they're sellling on the road, it will be ridiculous to not have parts.\\n- Any second hand car is better: you guys are dreaming.\\n- depreciation: there are huge claims in this subreddit about massive depreciation up to 50%. In reality, these cars are new and people are buying it. So, after 1.5 years that they have been on the market, the retail price is going up and couldn't find one below 25k on carsales.com.au.\\n- how it drives: it is a small suv, works as small suv, drives like a small suv. It is not a race car, or a sports car, and it is perfectly fine for under 110km/hrs. If we were in Europe with speed limits of 130 then I would reconsider.\\n\\nFeel free to ask any questions\\n\\nEDIT: for all the angry people I never said that it is the best car in the world. I'm only saying my expierience is different from what I read here and that after 1 year I think it is an amazing car for the price. In the future, it may rust, it may explode or whatever.

For something touted as the \"best truck in the world\" and the \"most popular truck in the world\", I\\'m not sure how people look past the reliability issues.\\n\\nHonestly, I wanted to make what the go was so I asked on r/Ford trucks, r/F150, r/Ford, and r/Trucks, instead I just got people blatantly saying that there hadn\\'t been these recalls and that their truck is the best truck.\\n\\nThis also excludes the Toyota Tundra because [although it\\'s officially in Australia, it\\'s not confirmed that it\\'s going to be sold in Australia](https://www.toyota.com.au/news/toyota-tundra-customer-evaluation-program-kicks-off) and it\\'s impossible to get a drive of.\\n\\nSo that leaves the two trucks that you can physically get your hands on, get in, and drive.\\n\\nThat\\'s the RAM 1500 Express and the Chevrolet Silverado LTZ, and I have to say.\\n\\nThe price difference between the base models is eye watering, $97,000 for the RAM and $147,000 for the Silverado is insane.\\n\\nBut.\\n\\nThe Silverado is definitely significantly nicer than the RAM, I would say it\\'s much closer to the RAM Laramie than it is to the Express, but the Laramie isn\\'t the base model, where the LTZ is.\\n\\nThe RAM, even in the Laramie trim is louder, has less features, and the fact that it can\\'t tow 4,500kg on a gooseneck is worrying in itself. RAM Australia has said that if you fit a Gooseneck, you immediately void all chassis and drivetrain warranties simply by having one fitted.\\n\\nWhich is interesting, because Goosenecks are more stable and offer significantly better weight distribution across axle groups over a traditional bumper pull setup. So it\\'s interesting that they say you can\\'t do it, and that it\\'s not rated.\\n\\nI have seen Ford Rangers and Hiluxes pulling Goosenecks before, if a fucking Ranger can do it, why can\\'t a RAM?\\n\\nThe features you get between the two are chalk and cheese, the Silverado has heated and cooled seats, adaptive cruise, lane keep, 360° Camera, and so on.\\n\\nThe RAM seems to be practically a whole generation behind in features, and the RAM dealer seemed to be more of a \"You get what you get\" type person rather than involve any conversation on the competition. Basically \"You buy this, or you buy that, I won\\'t discuss the differences or say why mine is better\"\\n\\n\"Basic\" (modern car) features that the Chevrolet has and the Ram are missing include Adaptive cruise control, Lane Keep Assistance, 360° Camera, Multiple Reversing Camera Angles, Remote Start, and rear USB charging ports.\\n\\nFrom a purely driving perspective, the Chevrolet sits in the lane better, it has much more direct feel on the steering, and not once did I run out of power driving it. Even towing, if I reached for that right pedal, it was there.\\n\\nAlso, GMSV let me have the car for 36 hours to live with, and that allowed me to do a trip to Hammerbarn, it let me go to the tip and take rubbish, it let me get in Highway time, it let me get city time, I got to park it and live with it.\\n\\nRAM was \"Let\\'s run around the block, 20 minute, in town, 5 minutes on the highway \"\\n\\nI feel that Ran tried to hold onto \"We\\'re first in the market\" for too long, and then GM and Ford came in with a much better product.\\n\\nIf I\\'m going from a 79 Series to a 1500 Express, sure, the 1500 Express seems like a great car.\\n\\nBut anything with a little bit of tech, the 1500 Express is a step backwards.\\n\\nI\\'m super disappointed for all the hype and everything on the F150, I just can\\'t see why it\\'s so popular when it\\'s practically unavailable to test drive due to recalls for months on end. Makes you wonder, you drop $140,000+ on one, how much time is it gonna be in the workshop or off the road due to faults?\\n\\nAesthetically, the F150 is by far my favourite, and from sitting in it, although not being allowed to drive, it is my favourite for the cabin layout.\\n\\nHonestly, after what GM did in the shutdown of Holden, I genuinely never thought I would look towards another GM product, but it seems that they have the best on the market.\\n\\nFinally, with the Silverado I got to actually experience loving with the car.\\n\\n1) Why the fuck do some people take up 4 car spaces to park the cunt? It\\'s not that big.\\n\\n2) Why do so many people in Hiluxes and rangers pull up next to you on the highway and rev the cunt out of their car and speed past you?\\n\\n3) Why do people say they are \"fuel guzzling\"? I averaged 12.5l/100 mixed Highway and Inner City, previously my utes have done around 12.3-12.8l/100km and that\\'s been a Hilux, a Ranger, and a T60. So it seems on par with economy to smaller utes.\\n\\n4) Why isn\\'t it possible to get this level of comfort in a Ranger or Hilux? This is simply proof that you can build a good comfortable ute that also doubles as a work vehicle and yet no other manufacturers seem to do it in the smaller utes.\\n\\n5) Why is this in the Jeep Gladiator the only utes on the market to have a sunroof?\\n\\n6) Why is a 12 pin trailer plug not standard? So useful.\\n\\n7) Why are electric brakes not standard on other utes, they\\'re included in the Chev and the RAM, why keep a safety device out of other utes?\\n\\n8) Why don\\'t other utes have a HUD standard in the base model?\\n\\nI mean, I have to say, the Silverado is probably the single best appointed base model ute available in Australia when you compare features, capabilities, and price. It\\'s actually pretty good value.\\n\\nIt\\'s still stupid expensive, but when you compare it in price to a GR Landcruiser 300 Series, you\\'re getting more shit, and more capabilities, for less money.', 'small city hatches used to be less than 16k entry level. but for a brand new one , the city hatchback that was economical and can fit tight spaces. only option is mg 3 or kia picanto above 20k when it hits road ( thanks dealers) in sydney. why are govt talking about environment and also allowing gigantic gas guzzlers. and still stopping the small cars. now they can freely import cars from anywhere in the world with legislation. the cars importers are also charging upwards of 15k to 20k for a used one. what is the way around for this situation.', 'I’m debating whether to buy a new or relatively new used Mustang.

Here's a breakdown:\\n\\n ##What it covers:\\n\\nInjuries to others: CTP primarily covers bodily injury or death caused to other people in a car accident. This includes:\\n\\n1)Other drivers\\n2) Passengers in other vehicles\\n3) Pedestrians\\n4) Cyclists\\n5) Motorcyclists\\n\\n##What it doesn't cover:\\n\\n1)Damage to vehicles or property: It does not cover damage to your own vehicle, the other driver's vehicle, or any other property.\\n2) Your own injuries: It doesn't cover your own medical expenses or lost income if you are injured in an accident.\\n\\n##How it works:\\n\\n1) Mandatory: You must have valid CTP insurance to register your vehicle in Australia.\\n\\n2) State variations: The specific rules and regulations regarding CTP insurance can vary slightly between Australian states and territories.\\n\\nIncluded in registration: In some states, the cost of CTP is included in your vehicle registration fees. In others, you need to purchase it separately from a licensed insurer.\\n\\n\\nKey Points:\\nCTP insurance is essential for all vehicle owners in Australia.\\n\\nIt provides crucial financial protection for others who may be injured in an accident caused by you.\\n\\nIt is important to understand the specific rules and coverage limits that apply in your state.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This information is for general knowledge and guidance only. It is not a substitute for professional legal or financial advice.\\n\\nI recommend contacting your state's road transport authority or an insurance broker for the most up-to-date and accurate information on CTP insurance in Australia.\\n\\n#Self Insurance (Uninsured)\\n\\nSelf-insurance means that instead of paying premiums to an insurance company, an individual or entity assumes the financial responsibility for potential losses themselves.\\n\\n##How it works:\\n\\n1) You set aside a specific amount of money (often in a reserve fund) to cover potential losses.\\n\\n2) When a loss occurs (like a car accident, medical expense, or property damage), you pay for it out-of-pocket from your reserves.\\n\\n##Pros:\\n\\n1) Potential cost savings: If losses are lower than expected, you can save money compared to insurance premiums.\\n2) Greater control: You have more control over claim decisions and how your funds are used.\\n\\n##Cons:\\n\\n1) Significant financial risk: You bear the full financial burden of any losses, which could be substantial.\\n\\n2) Requires careful financial planning: You need to accurately assess potential risks and ensure you have sufficient reserves.\\n\\nIn essence, self-insurance is a risk management strategy where you take on the financial responsibility for potential losses rather than transferring that risk to an insurance company.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This is a simplified explanation. Self-insurance can be complex and involves various legal and financial considerations.\\n\\n#Third Party Property & Legal Liability\\n\\nIn Australia, Third Party Property & Legal Liability insurance in the context of motor vehicles primarily covers the costs of damage you cause to someone else's vehicle or property while driving.\\n\\n\\nFocus: Primarily covers financial losses incurred by others due to your driving.\\n\\n##Key Coverage:\\n\\n1) Damage to another person's vehicle.\\n2) Damage to other people's property (fences, buildings, etc.).\\n3) Legal Liability: Helps cover legal costs if you are sued by someone for property damage caused by your vehicle.\\n\\n***Important Note: This type of insurance does not cover damage to your own vehicle.***\\n\\nKey Differences from Compulsory Third Party (CTP) Insurance:\\n\\n1) CTP is mandatory in all Australian states and territories.\\n2) CTP focuses on covering bodily injury or death to another person caused by your vehicle.\\n\\nThird Party Property & Legal Liability insurance provides crucial financial protection for you if you accidentally cause damage to someone else's property while driving. It's a valuable addition to your overall car insurance coverage.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This is a general overview and may not cover all specific situations or variations in policy terms.\\n\\nAlways refer to your policy documents or consult with an insurance professional for detailed information.\\n\\nSome third party liability coverage will provide a minor level of cover if you are hit by a self-insured/uninsured driver and may also provide some level of cover in the case your vehicle is damaged in a fire or it is stolen, This is not standard across all policies and may be an optional extra on top of the basic cover. \\n\\n#Comprehensive Insurance\\n\\nComprehensive motor vehicle insurance in Australia provides the broadest coverage for your vehicle. It typically covers:\\n\\n1) Damage to your vehicle: This includes accidents, fire, theft, natural disasters (storms, floods, hail), and vandalism.\\n2) Third-party property damage: Covers damage you cause to other vehicles or property.\\n3) Legal Liability coverage for the chats of legal fees\\n\\nOptional extras: These can include things like roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement, and personal accident cover.\\n\\nAgreed Value vs. Market Value:\\n\\n##Agreed Value:\\n\\nYou and the insurer agree on the value of your vehicle at the time of policy inception. If your vehicle is declared a total loss, you receive the agreed-upon amount, regardless of its market value at the time of the claim. This is beneficial for classic, vintage, or modified cars that may be worth more than their market value.\\n\\n##Market Value:\\n\\nThe insurance company pays you the market value of your vehicle at the time of the loss. This is determined by factors like age, condition, mileage, and current market prices.\\n\\nImportant Note: Comprehensive insurance usually does not cover wear and tear, mechanical breakdowns, or damage caused by driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This is a general overview. Always refer to your specific policy documents for detailed coverage information and exclusions\\n\\n#Key Notes:\\n\\nA lot of insurance policies will not cover you in the event that you are operating a vehicle illegally \\n\\nSo if your vehicle is not compliant with roadworthiness requirements in your state or territory, Or in the event your vehicle needs engineering And it does not have it, Then a claim can be denied. \\n\\nAlthough this does not come into play in every claim, this will certainly be a factor if the part of your vehicle that is unroadworthy or has been modified illegally is the cause of the accident or contributes to the accident being more severe. \\n\\nClaims can also be declined if you are speeding or driving in a manner that is dangerous or charged with some dangerous driving offences, however, this is less common.\\n\\nIn the event that you are operating the vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol, this can also void a policy. \\n\\nNot all insurance policies will cover you if you are off-road or on private property, however, some will cover you in the case that you are in an area you are legally allowed to be \\n\\nSome insurance policies will place driver restrictions on the policy, meaning that only listed drivers can drive it, And some policies will place a household restriction that everyone that lives in the same residence as yourself is required to be listed on the policy. \\n\\nEver since the banking royal commission in Australia, insurance companies are legally required to insure only the financial owner of the vehicle, meaning that if you are not the financial owner, it is insurance fraud to take out insurance on something that you do not own. \\n\\nThis is an incredibly common tactic where parents will insure a car that is owned by their children in order to avoid higher premiums and bring the cost of insurance policies down. \\n\\nInsurance fraud is a criminal offence in Australia, And if you are caught conducting insurance fraud, you can face jail time and incredibly large fines, And this may impact you in the future if you try and purchase another financial product such as insurance or obtain a bank loan. \\n\\nFor at least of insurance companies that may be able to offer you cover you can go to https://www.findaninsurer.com.au/ which is a service run by the insurance Council of Australia.\\n\\nIf you need to make a complaint to the ombudsman for the insurance industry you can go to https://www.afca.org.au/ And logic complaint there with the ombudsman \\n\\nHowever, be aware that in order to have AFCA look at your case, you generally need to go through the complaints process for your insurance provider prior to raising this to the ombudsman \\n\\nThis subreddit takes a dim view on people recommending insurance fraud, any comments on this subreddit or any posts requesting for advice on how to commit insurance fraud will result in the post being removed \\n\\nFurther posts on the matter pertaining to advice on how to commit insurance fraud or request on how to commit insurance fraud will result in you being banned from this subreddit.\", 'I am looking to buy a car to keep long term (meaning keeping it till it dies). \\n\\nI do not want a SUV as the driving dynamics are extremely boring except maybe the Cupra Formentor. \\n\\nI want a car that handles well in corners, not just fast in a straight line.\\n\\nI have looked at the following cars-\\n\\nI30N sedan.

I have done beginner drift days and skid pan days in the past as well as try to work on my own cars as much as possible. \\n\\nSo I’m writing this as a lot of people think you need a car with 500hp and every modification under the sun to do a track day. Repeat with me “6 pot brakes do not make you stop faster” and hoping to encourage more people to give it a go.\\n\\nAll you need is a cheap but RELIABLE platform with some sort of aftermarket support or be good at making stuff. Manual gearbox is a must if you have a slow car like the trusty jazz. And it’s heaps more fun. We bought ours at 202,000km and incomplete service history. Changed the fluids and spark plugs and that’s it.\\n\\nGood budget platforms can be stuff like the Jazz, Toyota Echo Sportivo, Hyundai Excel, Yaris , Swift and Swift sport , there are some euro ones if you’d like to take a gamble like Renault Clio etc. before you commit to a nugget I would research if you can get A) good suspension to bolt in B) easy to find brake pads.\\n\\nIf you have a budget of more than $5k for just the car then you can get ratty mx5s and Civics etc for $8-10k which are a better platform to begin with but not needed.\\n\\nNow you have a Nuggét, these are the things you need to do a track day.\\n\\nTyres - Hankook RS4 should be the baseline tyre. They’re cheap $550 for 4 for 3 on special. RE003s and Pilot sports won’t cut it in the dry, you’ll probably overheat them. Tyres are your most important purchase , they will dictate your grip and braking performance.\\n\\nBrake pads - upgraded brake pads and OEM discs. You don’t need slotted or drilled. We use EBC yellow in the Jazz. Probably not the best pad for track use but we were in a time pinch and they are so far so good. Lots of people use Winmax W3 or Hawk. You’ll have to do some research for your own preference. \\n\\nBrake fluid - high temp brake fluid, we use Motul 600 RBF. Flush out your old fluid and put this in. Bleed the brakes. Enjoy not boiling the fluid when you brake hard after a few laps.\\n\\nFire extinguisher - Mounted on a metal bracket where the driver can reach. $40 extinguisher and bracket maybe $30-40? Free or cheap if you can make one.\\n\\nHelmet - Motorcycle helmets are usually okay but check the organisers rules. Car helmets sometimes have extra things for HANS devices. You can pick up one from $150 all the way up to $3k decide how much your head is worth. \\n\\nTyre deflator and inflator - You’ll want to check your tyre pressure after each session as cold and hot pressures will change a lot. I was told to aim for about 30psi hot. So I usually start the day at about 25/26psi cold and keep checking.\\n\\nWheel alignment - make sure your car is driving as it should and the suspension geometry is okay.\\n\\nAASA Motorsport day license $25 ish dollars. You need one of these to drive. You can also buy a yearly one if you plan to do more than a few events.\\n\\nThats it if you want to do it on a real budget. Make sure the car has no leaks, the brakes work, no loose items in the car and book in your first event!\\n\\nIf you enjoyed your first track day you can do more to your car! Because maybe you’ve been bit by the track bug.\\n\\nSeat - A racing seat will help tremendously in the corners, make sure you get reputable brand seats and high quality mounts.\\n\\nSuspension upgrades , coilovers, sway bars. Camber kits etc. This is where you can start spending money depending on how crazy you want to get.\\n\\nFor me I went with BC racing DS series with custom spring rates, basically following Honed Developments suspension recipe.

It was the sixth generation Ford Falcon and also included the Ford Fairmont (AU)—the luxury-oriented model range. The AU series replaced the EL Falcon and was constructed on the (at the time) new EA169 platform which continued to harbour Falcon models until 2010 when the BF wagon was discontinued, and Ford Territory models until 2011. The AU series was replaced by the updated BA series.\\n\\nThe AU series was conceived under *Project Eagle* that begun in February 1993, and gained the official codename *EA169* in October 1994. It was developed and brought to market in 1998 only after Ford Australia had given consideration to a revamped fifth generation Falcon and a fully imported replacement such as the American front-wheel drive Ford Taurus or rear-wheel drive Ford Crown Victoria, the European rear wheel-drive Scorpio and, reportedly, even the Japanese rear-wheel drive Mazda 929 (then part of the Ford conglomerate).\\n\\nThe above alternatives were eliminated in favour of a substantial redesign of the indigenous platform, due to concerns about the Australian market preference for high towing capacity, large interior size and local employment. Specific factors included, for example: research at the time indicated that 69% of Falcons were fitted with towbars and the perception that rear-wheel drive cars were better at towing; the fact that the import models had limited body style options (sedan only or sedan and wagon) and no capability to use a V8 engine.\\n\\nStylistically, this new generation Falcon sported Ford\\'s radically new global design language, labelled \"New Edge\". The aim of this design was to attract a younger generation of buyers with avant-garde looks, however, in Australia it polarized public opinion to the benefit of the more organically designed rival, the 1997 Holden Commodore (VT). The AU series had a very efficient drag coefficient of Cd=0.295 for the sedan (an 11% improvement over the preceding EL series) and 0.34 for the wagon.\\n\\nFor the first time in Falcon\\'s history, Independent Rear Suspension (IRS) became available as standard on some models and optional on others. It also featured Australian production firsts, such as Variable Cam Timing (VCT) on some 6-cylinder models and an adaptive automatic transmission on the high-performance T series with steering wheel gear shifting buttons.\\n\\nKey changes from the fifth generation Falcon included a 35 kg (77 lb) reduction in weight for the base car, 17.5 per cent stiffer bodyshell, and an eight per cent improvement in fuel consumption. Peculiarly, Ford Australia decided to use the original 1950\\'s font for the new \"Falcon\" and \"Futura\" badges.\\n\\nAs stated previously, the AU was the first Falcon to offer IRS (a double wishbone design on an isolated subframe). IRS was made available as a costly option on the base Forte, Fairmont and \\'S\\' models, and standard on Fairmont Ghia, XR6 VCT and XR8 models. The updated 6-cylinder engines incorporated advanced features such as VCT on some models and a temperature sensor in the cylinder head, which detected coolant loss and allowed the car to \"limp home\" safely by cutting cylinders. The engine range comprised: the base Intech model producing 157 kW (211 hp), with a revised cylinder head featuring smaller valve stems, larger exhaust valves, and different rocker ratio, as well as a revised piston and longer conrod and a cast aluminium cross-bolted oil sump (with the same power output as the EL series); an \"HP\" version reserved to the XR6 producing 164 kW (220 hp) (thanks to: unique cylinder head; reshaped inlet port; redesigned exhaust port; ‘open’ combustion chamber shape to restrict pre-detonation from hot spot areas; unique camshaft; higher fuel pressure; recalibrated EEC V engine management system); the VCT version producing 172 kW (231 hp) for the XR6 VCT; a *Windsor V8* producing 185 kW (248 hp) (also carried over from the EL series but without major upgrades).\\n\\nTransmissions were improved for better shift feel and the auto was recalibrated to better suit the upgraded engines. The six and eight cylinder models had a 4-speed BTR M93LE and M97LE automatic transmission, respectively. The automatic XR series models had an \"adaptive shift\" with five shifting strategies depending on driving conditions. The manual transmission, where available, was a 5-speed T5 model.\\n\\nThe program cost A$700 million before product launch and key staff included chief designer, Steve Park, and Marcus Hotblack, Manager of Interior Design.\\n\\nFor more information, please see the following:\\n\\n[AU Falcon Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Falcon_(AU))\\n\\n[Shannons Club - Has the AU Falcon become better with age?](https://www.shannons.com.au/club/forum/general/has-the-au-falcon-become-better-with-age/)\\n\\n[Top Gearbox - Ford\\'s Unloved Child - The AU Falcon](https://www.topgearbox.com/cars/entertainment/motoringbox/172877-views%E2%80%A2sep-5-2019-5-6k-140-share-save-motoringbox-16-7k-subscribers-today-were-looking-at-one-of-the-most-infamous-cars-to-ever-come-out-of-australia-a-car-which-has-generated/)\\n\\n[Trade Unique Cars - AU Falcon Buyers Guide](https://www.tradeuniquecars.com.au/buyers-guide/2001/2000-2002-ford-falcon-au-bfii-xr8-buyers-guide)\\n\\n[Australian Car Reviews - AU Falcon Buyers Guide](http://australiancar.reviews/reviews.php#!content=guide&make=Ford&model=Falcon&gen=237)\\n\\n[ProductReview - AU Falcon Product Reviews](https://www.productreview.com.au/listings/ford-falcon-au-1998-2002)\\n\\n[CarSales - All AU Falcons for sale in Australia](https://www.carsales.com.au/cars/?q=(And.Service.carsales._.(C.Make.Ford._.(C.Model.Falcon._.(Or.Series.AU._.Series.AU+II._.Series.AU+III.))))&sort=%7ePrice)\\n\\n*I am a human, and this action was performed manually.', 'Hi,\\nMe (21) and my girlfriend (25) is looking to get a car under 30.000$, since we do not know anything about cars, we are looking to get a reliable new car.

I’m aiming for something economical and practical, but I also need a bit of space since I don’t fit well in smaller city cars like the Kia Picanto.  \\n\\nRight now, I’m considering options like the Skoda like Scala model —something reliable and not too expensive to run. I’m also open to newer Chinese models with some loan to cover the difference in price, like the Chery Tiggo, or Haval Jolion (probably slightly used). The other option is a properly used car like the Skoda, but I’ve always heard people say to avoid anything with 100k+ miles, which leaves no options in my budget.  \\n\\nCan someone help me understand what I should actually look for when shopping online and in person? How do I check a car properly to avoid getting a lemon? Any tips or personal experiences would be super helpful!  \\n\\nThanks in advance!  \\n', 'Family with 1 kid, 1 on the way. Lost small SUV in no-fault write off and need a new car. Looking for a bigger SUV, live urban so not too big, etc. we go on long drives every 1-2 weeks and constantly need to do small trips with kids, but vast majority of the time the car is just sitting outside our house parked.\\n\\nWas thinking new/near-new as we plan to drive until it dies. Used prices still look too high. Was defaulting to Sorrento/SantaFe etc.\\n\\nSee that with many dealers, Skoda Kodiaqs are now 45k for a new base model with 6-7 years warranty left (ie late MY23 or MY24 with a 2024 rego date) and you can probably negotiate a bit off.  Many examples with 0-500km. And they have 2.99% financing: we could pay cash but this is a no-brainer to keep money in offset and set aside money for the balloon payment. Can get a sportline or optioned Style for 50k, although I don’t think you need any of that.\\n\\nWhy would I pay 15-20k more for a well-specced Rav 4 or a Santa Fe, or other examples? That’s equivalent to a massive holiday? I know Skoda depreciation is terrible but we will hold for at least a couple of years outside warranty. We will be low mileage, service on time, etc. - Skodas are considered reliable outside Australia and we are VIC so can go to a few dealers or independents if a dealer stuffs us around. Servicing is a little more but other savings like financing even that out - and I’m saving 10-20k upfront. \\n\\nI know something like a Rav 4 or even Santa Fe will last longer; but if the Skoda has 7 years of warranty life and then at least a few years with expensive repairs - it seems bizarre to spend 10-20k more on the expectation of usage in over a decade? Especially when the Skoda drives well, is big, nice interior etc \\n\\nI’d previously been brainwashed by John Cadogan about the VW Group so I feel stupid  but this seems like a good deal…any thoughts would be welcome!', \"Hi, Im struggling to find the right car for my family..\\n\\nI need to sell my WM Holden Statesman and get a family car. I'd like something as good on fuel as possible. Absolute maximum i can afford is $20,000 but prefer closer to $10,00-15,000. \\nWould like an SUV and need to be able to fit pram and shopping in boot. Mostly used for commuting from home to childcare and work but also will be going on 2 day road trips every year or so to visit family. Also needs to be reliable as low income means not much money for maintenance costs!\\n\\nSo basically I need an all-rounder! Am I fantasizing about a car that doesnt exist in that price range?\\n\\nI know with that price range my options are limited but would love to hear anyones opinion!\", 'I\\'m in need of buying a car asap, and I’m not sure how to prepare for it. Ive heard Toyotas, Mazdas and Subarus are good, to consider mileage and condition, and if possible to inspect it prior to purchase... but what can you guys recommend me when purchasing a second hand car?\\n\\nWhat\\'s the minimum knowledge about cars that I need to be informed pre- and post-purchase, and where are the most efficient resources to get it? Is there a good \"buying your first car\" guide out there that I\\'m just missing?\\n\\nI\\'m just as interested in what I need to know than specific advice for my circumstances, but both are good. Especially because I feel like I’m massively overthinking this. I\\'m 24 but still pretty new to all this. \\nI don’t care much about the interior conditions of the car, but I am looking for an economical and reliable car. The car would be used to commute to and from work, so just under 1 hour each way (about 70km each way), so I guess that’s something to keep in mind. Also I am in NSW, but close to QLD, in case registering it in a different state would make sense? My budget is basically just as cheap as I can find, while still being reliable… Thanks a lot everyone!!', '', 'Reading a cross section of the opinions found in this sub, I thought I’d add mine, as someone who likes cars of all types, loves driving and has owned a Tesla Model 3 Long Range for over a year.\\n\\nFirst up, to set the scene: I can get down with an MX5. I think the AU Falcon is possibly the fugliest shit stain to grace Australian roads this side of a SsangYong Stavic, though I do have fond memories of my friend’s not-quite-so-fugly XD with its agricultural 4-speed manual and non-power assisted steering, which made trying to hurry it a physical work-out and near-death experience. I very much like a Barra swap.\\n\\nI’ve been to the odd hill-climb, rally, track day (as a spectator), and car show over the last 20 years. I’ve mainly owned hot hatches, including a Peugeot GTI6, Golf MK6 GTI, Renault Clio 172 Sport, Renault Megane RS265, BMW M135i (2013).\\n\\nI’m comfortable doing basic maintenance myself, such as oil and filter changes, discs and pads. My step dad is a retired mechanic with a hoist in his back yard, and I’ve assisted with more complex jobs, like engine mounts and auxiliary belts.\\n\\nI currently own a 2013 Mazda 6 Wagon, a 2004 Subaru Forester SG9 STI and a Tesla Model 3 Long Range with the acceleration boost.\\n\\nI think Elon Musk is a bit of a dickhead. On a good day.\\n\\nBesides the Tesla, the most powerful car I’ve driven was my friend’s 2007 AMG S63. (386KW, 630NM)\\n\\nWith that context behind us, let’s begin.\\n\\nSo… I really loved the M135i. Until the big end bearings went on the N55 with less than 100,000km. I’d owned it since 42,000km, always religiously maintained it, including in that time, 2 rocker cover and gasket replacements (fucking plastic rocker covers that warp and leak), radiator replacement, oil leak fixes from near turbo and oil filter, replacement charge pipe (again plastic, WTF), and the usual consumables such as brakes and tyres.\\n\\nAn engine replacement with a second hand N55 was going to cost $15K. A rebuild likely above and beyond. I think an N55 crank was alone going to be 3K, let alone rods, pistons and what ever else it needed, plus labour. (If you’re about to comment, “jusT Throw In sOme neW BeArings anD sell it”, you’re a cunt. Go fuck yourself.)\\n\\nI read people talk about the S58 being reliable… Shit, maybe within warranty… BMW, love your cars, but never again…\\n\\nAnyway, I digress…\\n\\nThis was during 2020, I was out of work due to COVID and sold my baby, broken, for $15K, sucked it up and found the most reliable family car I could within my budget: a 2013 Mazda 6 wagon with 65,000KM. \\n\\nMy wife loved it. Anonymous. Instantly, people acted less like dickheads, let you merge. Stopped trying to race you. We still have it.\\n\\nI still had my RS265, which was a great car. Absolutely zero issues over 3 years. French reliability. Still the best handling car I’ve ever driven. FWD haters have no idea. Yes, traction off the line was something to be managed, but on the road, the chassis balance was in another league.\\n\\nI took a full-time job, saved some money, and after some man maths, a few months working on my wife, we test drove a Tesla Model 3 Long Range. The instant torque, 0-100 in 4.4 seconds felt like a cheat code. People talk about 0-100 times of other cars, but forget, that’s with launch control. The Tesla does it all day, every day, just by pressing the pedal. Real world, there are very few cars that come close.\\n\\nI bought the car at just under $79K. The most I’d ever spent before was 50. It was a stretch, but $30K down and financing the rest at 1.99% over 4 years and a balloon of about $23K works out to $155 a week.\\n\\nIn the BMW and the Megane, I averaged around 12L per 100km. Must be the way I drive, but I don’t know why you buy a performance car if you’re trying to be fuel efficient. With solar, charging during the day (about $1200 to buy and install the wall connector) basically means no fuel costs, and maintenance is also just tyres, brakes, etc. So my moderate man maths calls this $3K savings a year, or $15K over 5 years, bringing the cost down to around $65K. I also feel the resale will be better than average at \\\\~$40k+. I’m sure you’ll tell me why I’m wrong in the comments, but considering the TCO of the BMW, I feel I’m ahead. 😊\\n\\nDriving wise, it handles really well. Like *really* well. The weight is low and the steering is super direct and confidence inspiring, though not a lot of feel. The torque out of the corners is biblical. I bought the acceleration boost ($3K) the day it became available, dropping the 0-100 to 3.9 seconds. Quarter mile in 11.9. It is fucking absurdly quick. It has a 10ms torque response, meaning you have \\\\~650NM of torque at any speed delivered in 1/100th of a second. There is nothing faster you can buy bang for buck.\\n\\nTraction control with electric motors is superb. You can get a modicum of rear biased turn in on throttle (the rear *will* kick out), but no smoky burnouts, and the front also does voodoo to pull you into line.\\n\\nI hear people parrot that there’s ‘no soul’, but I suspect they haven’t actually driven one and are just talking out their arse. It is a fun car.\\n\\nThe one thing I hate are the seats – they need more side bolstering. Also, yes, touch screens are not the best choice for all controls.\\n\\nBesides driving, what I love: the stereo is seriously excellent; the glass roof is cool, and heated seats and steering wheel are lovely in winter.\\n\\nI’ve driven it from Brisbane to Sydney, used the Tesla charger network and it was fine. About 20 to 25 minutes a stop to charge from 40% to 90% every 2 to 2.5 hours. Around town I probably get around 500km to a full charge, though only charge to 85% to preserve the life of the battery. \\n\\nWhen we’ve gone away for a weekend, just plugging in to a power point is enough to give you at least 200km range overnight. (3pm-9am)\\n\\nI drive from Ferny Hills to St Lucia for work, 35 mins, and it takes about 4% of the battery.\\n\\nI get that it’s expensive and not accessible for a lot of people, but for those for whom it may be viable, just take one for test drive. Make up your own mind.\\n\\nOh, and it absolutely spanks the AMG S63.', \"I am fighting for my vehicle Jaguar E-pace 2020 to be fixed \\n\\n \\n\\nIn July my vehicle had an engine light come on and the car was running at no power. Jaguar roadside assist was called & they sent out an NRMA team guy to look over the vehicle. The NRMA guy had showed us the codes that came up on this car which were a persistent\\n misfire & running on 3 cylinders. There was nothing NRMA could do on their end to fix the vehicle so it had to be sent to the closest dealership. The vehicle was then towed to the closest dealership\\n\\n \\n\\nThe vehicle was scheduled to be assessed on the 6th of August 2024. Dealership has stated that there is a misfire & that the car was a 15K job. Dealership also stated that this issue has a bulletin that addresses how\\n to fix the issue. We also asked what was the needs for this job as to why is it 15K? Dealership said this was for a lot of parts that they needed to order like injectors etc.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThis was being put through Extended warranty through Alliance. Dealership needed some extra information from myself about the service history which I happily provided. I sent in via email X2 service history invoices to be passed on to Alliance as they were needing\\n these to proceed with the claim. The reason my car was not serviced at a Jaguar dealership was due to living in a non-Jaguar/land rover dealership town. I had also asked the Dealership  if he could send through documentations as to what is needing to be done to this\\n vehicle, I never received this.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe claim on this vehicle was approved on the 22nd of August. Dealership stated that my car would be completed with a wait time of 2 weeks & there was a backorder of a product.  \\n\\nI didn’t hear back from Dealership for a little bit of time so I contacted them on the 11th of September via email following up on any updates on my vehicle. Dealership contacted back & said part is still on backorder with no ETA. They sent through description of this\\n part which is part number:. 10699L and a quote of $3500.80? Where this is not stated on the invoice, I will later bring up further along the line. This part was ordered on the 12th of August, a month already gone by.  \\n\\n \\n\\nI was also receiving updates via Jaguar customer service . The only updates I was receiving were the same thing every time, parts were on backorder & there was no ETA on this part.  \\n\\nOne day jag customer service contacted me & said that they had ordered this part from 3 different countries to see which one arrived the quickest which I thought was strange. There was one that had an ETA & it was coming from Europe arriving into Melbourne on the 21st of\\n October 2024. These phone calls are all be recorded through Jaguar.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWe are now in October Wednesday the 23rd 2024, i have contacted the Dealership to see if he has received this part as it was arriving on the 20th or 21st. The bloke I was dealing with stuttered abit & said it has arrived. I said great when will the process start & completion be completed?\\n He said that they were waiting for a hoist & car will not be completed by end of next week, this was via phone call. My father received a phone call 5 minutes after our chat & had been told that the vehicle should be done by the end of the day. I then received\\n via email not long after this call that he had been out the back and the vehicle was being worked on & will be completed by the end of the week.  \\n\\nTo me this all felt strange as to how it was going to be done end of next week to end of this week to now being completed the 24th of October 2024.  \\n\\nI emailed the dealership if we could pick the vehicle up on Saturday the 26th of October as we live 3 hours away & have the day off work. As their website states their opened Monday to Saturday.  \\n\\nSimon says that the service department is closed on Saturdays, so we chose to leave Friday around lunch to travel to Albury.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIt’s Friday the 25th of October & we arrived at the Dealership around 3.30pm to pick up the vehicle. When we got the car was not ready & it took them 10 minutes to find paperwork. Meanwhile I had called up this morning to let them know I was coming to pick the\\n car up.  \\n\\nPaperwork was given to us & they had showed us photos of oil being found throughout the engine & stated that this has all been cleaned. They also shown us a photo of the dash with an oil light on & I noticed that they reached a speed of 130kms with an oil\\n light on. I will attach a photo of this.  \\n\\nMy father also states that there were no injectors replaced when they said these were one of the things being replaced from the start. He states that they didn't need replacing?  I have now also noticed that the invoice is invoiced at $ 4744.50 not $15,000.\\n Dealership said he drove this car & it drives like a brand-new car.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWe proceeded outside to collect the vehicle. I’ve noticed before jumping inside the vehicle that the number plate was being held on by a cable tie & the fuel cap was sticking out & looked unusual. I checked the fuel cap & this had been broken & there was tape\\n holding it together.  \\n\\nWe then went back inside to show the bloke I was dealing with as my car never left my house this way & should not be leaving the dealership like this. He comes out & asks what’s wrong with it when you can clearly see it’s bent & does not sit in properly. He also asks us how does\\n it normally open, you push it and it bounces out. Shouldn't a jaguar worker know this? My mother says it should just pop open and he goes I know how it works, which I found rude. They knew nothing about this & tried to put it on me saying it could have\\n come like this, which we then said it never left our house like this. He took a photo of the issue & was going to look into it. He also states that they do not do work like this. \\n\\n \\n\\nI proceeded to leave the dealership & noticed the car felt unusual to drive so I swapped drivers with my father & let him drive. We drive off & an engine light comes on, car loses power & starts jerking. This almost resulted into an accident getting onto the\\n highway. This all happened within 5 minutes of leaving the dealership.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWe now are on our way back to the dealership as this was unacceptable. My father told the dealership that the issue was not fixed & the dealership said I drove that car yesterday 200kms and it drove like a brand-new car. My father said get in the car and see what we are talking\\n about. Worker jumped in pushed the throttle all the way down revved it & said I can hear the problem and took it straight to the garage to be looked at Monday.  \\n\\nWe are now 3 hours away leaving with no fixed car after 3 months.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe 28th of October I received an email from the dealership that the cylinders are down on compression causing miss fire. He said the state of the engine is such that is now unserviceable and a new engine will be required.  \\n\\nDealership says I will be looking at a completed repair bill of $48,251.00. I contacted dealership  asking is this going through Alliance Warranty as this is way out of my control. Via phone call with dealership - says this will be coming out of my own pocket due to the wrong oil\\n being used. The wrong oil was never used.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThere was a phone call between my father & dealership. My father says something about the fuel cap & that it needs to be fixed, worker states that the car was broken into to syphon fuel out. Meanwhile they tried to blame me for this & I never received an apology.\\n We also said that this was a $15,000 job & said it was, but we said how when the invoice is invoiced at $4744.50. Dealership also told us that they are being audient (being looked into). That defiantly says something's dodgy with this dealership. Simon kept\\n refusing to put the claim through & we proceeded to contact someone higher in the Jaguar department.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWe also asked Simon about some of the parts on the invoice & he could not explain this to us.  \\n\\nSimon had called up our mechanic and asked what oil he had used; he had told him the wrong oil due to being put on the spot and not knowing what car he was talking about. Simon proceeded to write down on the invoice of the mechanics the wrong oil & sent it\\n in for a claim. We contacted our mechanic & the right oil was used 0W20 & he spoke to Simon clearing this up on the right oil he used.  \\n\\nNow Simon is saying it is still not acceptable because it is not a long-life oil.  \\n\\nThe claim was not accepted.  \\n\\n \\n\\nI’ve also spoken to someone in the warranty company & i have described to them about the oil not being correct and resulted into needing a new engine. They said that our stories are different as to why it didn't get accepted. Simon is not telling me the full\\n story or something's gone wrong with my car. \\n\\nHe couldn't tell me much as this is due to being a manufacturer warranty.  \\n\\n \\n\\nI am a 24-year-old lady, 2 weeks away from giving birth as a single mother. I am being left without a car & am still currently paying off this car. I would like for Jaguar to fix the issue as i am being treated unfairly & my car has been treated with disrespect.\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nHow do I not know the car has resulted to this due to: \\n\\nThe car being broken into to syphon fuel out? \\n\\nWas it stolen?  \\n\\nHow did my car do 130 on the speedo with an oil light & running on 3 cylinders?  \\n\\nAlso why was the car not picked up from the start that it was running on low compression & needing a new engine?  \\n\\n \\n\\nWhy did Simon say this is a $15,000 job but its $4744.50?  \\n\\nWhy was this a 2-week job turned into 3 months? \\n\\nHow did the car drive smooth for them when immediately i had an engine light straight away? \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter all of the debacle my vehicle was sent back to Griffith via a tow truck. We then made a phone call to a different dealership as this is where the vehicle was originally purchased from. We spoke to Trent & explained the situation. Trent had told us due to the sludge\\n throughout the engine this could have been created due to spark plugs, solenoids a cvv which was changed. My vehicle was towed to the next dealership  & Trent had got back to us with the vehicle needing 2 solenoids changed. Trent had put this through Alliance warranty\\n as my vehicle has extended warranty. Alliance declined this claim & Trent tried his best to get them to approve it. Jaguar accepted this as a goodwill & Trent told us that if anything else is wrong within the extended warranty period that they will fix the\\n issue. I have this in email also from Trent.  \\n\\nOnce the claim was approved this only took a couple days and the vehicle was ready to be picked up. We drove to Sydney with my newborn baby who was only 4 weeks. Upon arrival Trent explained to us what was done & that the oil in the vehicle looked fine. 1st dealership\\n had changed the oil previous fix, but vehicle was not fixed.  \\n\\nThe vehicle was ready to be driven off. Once on the highway heading towards Newcastle way the vehicle started to slow down & stalling. Lucky my brother was on the highway & pulled up behind me as it was just myself & my baby.  \\n\\nThe vehicle was then towed away again. Jaguar refused to take this back to the 2nd dealership as this is where i wanted it to go. They said the 2nd dealership was more than 100ks from where i was when it was only around 50ks. The vehicle was taken to a 3rd dealership which is 4ks from\\n The 2nd dealership .  \\n\\nJaguar told me the vehicle was being taken to Northern beaches JLR. When i called northern beach, my vehicle was not there. Lucky the tow truck had told me where they took it. How did Jaguar not know where my vehicle went?  \\n\\n3rd dealership told me that my vehicle needs a service & that this could fix the issue. The vehicle did not need a service until another 200kms. Not sure how a service will fix a cylinder misfire. Then he had come back to tell me they were following a bullentin. This\\n is what the 1st dealership had done. I explained that this was already done & it does not need to be done again. He said they were going to send off the oil & get it tested. 1st dealership were the last to change the oil. They were horrible at getting back to me with updates.\\n I had to ring & they told me it needed a new engine. I asked if they sent off the oil, they said they didn't need to then they told my father they looked at the oil with their eyes & there was sludge throughout the oil. They could not give me an answer to\\n why it needs a new engine. They said the services played a part in it. The vehicle had up to date services.  \\n\\n3rd dealership tried to put this claim through, this was knocked back by JLR.

Just landed in Adelaide 3 days ago. From the UK. I definitely need a car here as public transport isn’t very reliable. Having to take Uber quite frequently which is not good for my wallet and I don’t get paid for another month because payroll takes time so have set a budget of $7.5K for a car not including third party property insurance and government charges and rego\\n\\nI saw a 2010 Holden Cruze on Carsales with 200K on it. Looked ok. A car of this age and mileage I wouldn’t expect to be in mint condition and would defo expect some wear and tear. Was 5K AUD for the car so I thought it was very cheap. In person inspection showed big strips of chipped paint here and there which wasn’t obvious in the picture but if they were that obvious in person I thought they should mention those at least. But hey at least it can get me from A to B without breaking down every so often or so I thought. Drove it around the yard and there were knocking noises from the hood. Another red flag because this was not declared in the description online but drove ok otherwise without staling. Was still happy and serious as the price was cheap for me and I was happy with the car if it had a life of another 2 years which is when I will plan to upgrade and just for peace of mind I arranged a PPI and (I don’t know much about cars other than driving and making the usual oil and tyre checks) I was shocked that this thing had an oil leak under the hood. So defo not even worth 5K in my book and not suitable for me given I am new to Australia and the last thing I would want is to be dealing with a car that breaks down constantly and doesn’t get me from A to B whilst I am already stressed about the move and adjusting to a new country. I did feel that it was fishy that the dealer didn’t want me to get the keys to open the hood and he just went inside leaving me outside so I didn’t get a proper look at the car but even then I am not a car person and given the dealer wasn’t very forthcoming about the cosmetic damage (I don’t mind cosmetic damage but the fact that the car’s condition didn’t match the description on car sales website was a big red flag for me). Dealer kept going on and on about how good condition the car is in and that he has already had the car inspected and the mechanic has given it the OK (I didn’t ask him for the official report or similar but even then I didn’t trust him and that maybe the mechanic will also get a commission if this car gets sold to me). He asked me to make a decision quickly because there two more people wanting to buy the car and he is only holding because I came first. I get a PPI which cost around $300 and they declared the car possibly unroadworthy even! \\n\\nWhat else can I do to avoid buying a car I might regret? The $300s are gonna add up and I am looking at another car now so need to be very selective which cars I want a mechanic to inspect. I can inspect myself for obvious faults and the behavior of the dealer for red flags so that I spend the 300$s more wisely and also that if it is too cheap, there is something more to it ', 'Hello, me and my family are emigrating to Australia from the UK this year and I am looking for the perfect modern classic to use as a daily. \\nThis category of cars is that they are new enough to be comfortable and reliable.

We drove the car and really liked it, we noticed the car had some scuffs in the interior but he said the car will be fully detailed before pickup. We were also told by him that we will be given a full orientation of the car and its functions once we come and pick it up.\\n\\nThen another person came in to assist us, I am assuming is the sales advisor, we negotiated on the car and it was initially listed around $34k and when we checked the car it\\'s at $32.5k. We were able to negotiate a deal at $31.4k (could probably do better but I\\'m bad a negotiating). Dealer said they were a large group and is a \"fixed price\" car dealer, meaning they included detailing, a full tank of gas, and 3 months rego as part of the sale. I am paying the full amount so I didn\\'t take any finance with the dealer.\\n\\nNow the bad part begins,   \\nonce we picked up the car, we noticed that the interior of the car had more scuffs and marks that were not there previously, there was a smidge of white mark (possibly paint) in the leather seat and a drop of white paint on the side of the driver seat. I do think this is due to the detailing process. We complained to the sales advisor and all we got was he tried to vacuum it and will give us a cleaning product recommendation.\\n\\nAt this point, my partner and I were already disappointed and didn\\'t know what to do as this was our first car and making this decision has been difficult for us. \\n\\nComes the part where we take the picture beside the car, the sales advisor took the pictures from his phone and it took 3 days just to get a picture sent to my email and multiple text reminders. Once I have signed all the legal documents, he hurried us out of the building and into the car, there was no promise of car introductions and all, it was all a lie.\\n\\nThe tipping point for me to write up this post:  \\nHad an email notification saying that the car is successfully transferred under my name but I need to renew my rego as it is expiring in 3 weeks. I was puzzled and furious to learn that the rego has not been renewed by them. I gave the sales advisor a call and he said due to an issue in the system, they were unable to do it for us due to it being near the end of FY, so instead they need me to do it myself and they will reimburse it.\\n\\nNext thing I did was I wrote him an email to confirm that they will reimburse before I make such payments. I have yet to hear back from him as it has only been a few hours but we both were severely disappointed by the service and the false promises that were made.\\n\\nRegarding the car itself, did a mini road trip for the weekend and thankfully no issues whatsoever. We were both happy with the car but very disappointed with the non-existent service that was promised.\\n\\nMoving forward, I probably just need to follow up and see where this leads, but if they still don\\'t reply, what options do I have?\\n\\nSome background: I have been in Australia for almost 10 years and only got a reason recently to buy a car as my partner and I will be going to a new phase in our lives.

Wanted to do a complete timeline of this misadventure so that it might help someone avoid my mistakes. This has a lot of detail, so feel free to skip the end. But if you are considering a Mazda Diesel of the 2014-2018 variety (or heck, a Mazda Diesel at all) recommend you read it all. \\n\\n2022 - Wife is \"With Child\". I spent months convincing her that an Impreza probably isn\\'t going to cut it. I do a post on CarsAustralia. Several people mention the Mazda 6 Wagon as a good option. None mention the diesel issues. A VERY quick google doesn’t reveal any problems (though a later detailed search after purchase would). Wife finds a Mazda 6 wagon 2015 she likes, refuses to entertain the idea of a SUV and wants a wagon like its still the 90s. \\n\\nJan 2023 - We test drive the car, it drives well. We check to see if the pram fits in the boot. it does easily. The seller knows we are soon to have a kid. Initially have trouble with finance (plan is to buy the 6 under finance then sell the Impreza to pay off the loan). We argue with the bank that the car isn’t THAT old and is a Mazda, it is reliable (Ironic). They agree and finance the car. $19k later we own a Mazda 6 wagon.\\n\\nLate Jan - We pick up the car that weekend. Probably do 300-400km in it. First sign of trouble is the car stalls whilst driving after its been idling a while. Restart, and it stalls again. Restart, and its totally fine. Take it to the mechanic. He spends a week on it, no codes. No errors. No sign of fault. Can’t replicate. \\n\\nFeb – Car is fine\\n\\nMarch – Car dash lights up light a Christmas tree on the way home from having the baby seat installed (again, ironic), dash says pull over and don’t drive. Tow track to the mechanic. Mechanic is surprised to see the car given it was serviced the previous week. Turns out something (suspect a rat) has chewed the drive belt which cut the alternator. Easy fix. But sets the tone for what’s to come: more bad luck.\\n\\nLate March – The car is running rough. Really rough. I say to the wife “I think this thing is going to stall” as I stop at a corner, indicating to turn. I was right. It dies. I restart, and dead. Restart: Dead. Restart: dead. We sit there for a minute, blocking traffic when finally on the 8th or 9th attempt, the car restarts. I limp it home and immediately rip out the baby seat and install it in the Impreza, thanking whatever gods exist that I haven’t yet sold it. The 6 drive perfectly fine to the mechanic who spends the next month working on it.  I contact previous owner who claims to have no knowledge. I contact the mazda dealer it was purchased from, no history of a similar fault. \\n\\nApril – Mechanic cant fault it. Cant replicate the fault after putting 100s of Ks on it (with our permission). Eventually, the car wont start one morning, flat battery. Mechanic replaces the battery and says “Hopefully a faulty battery? Let us know how you go”. I refuse to let my son in the car. I suggest we sell the 6 whilst its running. Wife refuses, it is her car I can’t force her.\\n\\nJune – No sign of problems. We consider selling the Impreza. Wife was driving the 6 comes home and reluctantly admits the car emitted a weird thump and was struggling to change gear, numerous warning lights. Back the mechanic. Code about turbo pressure. Clear code, cant replicate fault. Again recommend we sell the car. Again, shot down. Mechanic recommends taking it direct to Mazda. Car goes to local Mazda dealer who describe it as of a “problematic era”. They spend a month and can’t replicate the fault. They replace a carbon sensor under an extended warranty. Mazda claim the car is fixed.\\n\\nJuly/August: Occasionally idling or starting a little rough, but no faults. Baby seat goes back in the Mazda, I was right: The Impreza was too small. \\n\\nSeptember: Car struggles to get up to speed when pulling onto freeway. Acts as if the accelerator is being mashed wildly, complete lack of power. Car dies 10km latter at 100km an hour on the freeway with kid in the back seat. But restarts no problems. Taken straight to Mazda. Tell the wife she can either sell the Mazda or she can take over dealing with it, but I nor kid won’t get in that car ever again. Wife agrees (reluctantly) to sell. \\n\\nMazda spend the next couple of weeks trying to replicate, eventually they do. Detected as a fuel pressure problem. They request ok to spend 2.5k to remove fuel system and test. We see no choice, only other option is to sell to a wrecker for bugger all. Fuel system test completed, no faults. Car still stalling. Mazda start slowly replacing fuel system parts one by one and testing to see if the car still faults. Suggest again to Mazda to hook up a multimeter to the fuel pump. Surprise! It’s a solenoid in the fuel pump starving the car of diesel. Mazda spend the next couple of weeks ordering replacements. They do this work for free, but still charge us the $2.5k for the fuel tests, that didn’t detect a fault even though it WAS in the fuel system.\\n\\nSell the Impreza to clear the debt, sell the Mazda for $11k to a business (couldn’t in good faith sell it privately in case another family got screwed). Told the wife we’re getting a new SUV with a warranty to stop this happening again, sold my baby (not the actual one, the Impreza) to fix this mess so its my call, she agrees cause she is over it too. Go out and order a Kia Sportage which is what we probably should have done in the first place.\\n\\nTLDR: People love Mazda, but when push comes to shove I\\'d argue they don’t know their cars as well as you’d hope. It took them 2 goes and several months to fix it. And even then I sold it before I found out if it was truly fixed at a decent loss. The 6 was a great car, I understand why the wife struggle to want to sell it.

I’m after a pre-owned automatic small/compact SUV that is around $20k or less, under 100,000 km, around 5 years old or newer, good fuel economy (for long-distance and highway driving), and higher ground clearance (for occasional gravel/uneven terrain, not off-roading). I’m also looking for a car with features like cruise or adaptive cruise control, Apple CarPlay, reverse camera, rear sensors, and decent safety features.\\n\\nFor context, I’m currently working as an ecologist and sometimes need to travel long distances for field work (e.g. to the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast), so highway efficiency and comfort matter. The car will mostly be used by me and occasionally one passenger, so back seat space isn’t a priority, and a standard-sized boot will be more than enough.\\n\\nRight now, I’m driving a problematic 2010 Audi A3 that I bought from a shady dealer. It has given me a huge headache and I’m often stressed that something bad might happen when I’m on the road. Yes… I know I shouldn’t have bought a pre owned euro car, let alone from a shady dealer… I’ve learnt my lesson :’)\\n\\nSince I don’t know too much about cars, I’m not confident buying privately and will be sticking to dealers (I know the prices will be higher). I’ve heard of big dealers like Cars4Us, Big Box Cars, and Motorama. Are they reliable? If anyone has good experiences (or warnings) about Brisbane dealers, please let me know!\\n\\nSo far, the cars I’ve seen online that fit my criteria are the 2019/2020 Hyundai Kona Go and the 2021 Kia Stonic S YB. I’ve also come across models like the Mitsubishi ASX and Nissan Qashqai within this price range, but I have not done much research on them. I’m mainly looking at Japanese or Korean brands due to their reputation for reliability and lower maintenance costs. At the moment, I’m most drawn to the Hyundai Kona based on its reviews, features and appearance. I know Toyotas and Hondas are usually recommended, but I haven’t found any that meet my criteria and budget (they tend to be older or higher in kms for the same price).\\n\\nI would really appreciate any advice or thoughts whether it’s on the models I’m looking at, other car model recommendations, dealer experiences or any other suggestions.\\n\\nThanks in advance!\\n', \"Hello, I am looking for a car with good fuel economy and cheap servicing.

If you put 91 fuel into a car which requires 95, you’ll get engine “knocking” - in other words,  the fuel detonates \\\\*before\\\\* the engine actually ignites it, which creates a jarring, shuddering effect.

If you are doing long distance, it's borderline useless in Australia. So many of the chargers don't work properly if it's not a tesla super charger. And there aren't enough superchargers around. I have to plan a lot for a road trip, but generally it's more annoying than prohibitive. \\n- If you don't have home charging, it can be a real problem. But this problem is getting better. \\n- association with Elon and other EV nuts. Most people who drive cars just want a comfortable car, but some of the EVangelists are a bit much. \\n- more expensive to buy for like for like. Ev version of the same brand car is more expensive \\n- high depreciation. Although this may be slightly over stated. \\n- slightly more expensive insurance. \\n- long wait to get fixed if you get into an accident. We waited 4 months for a panel to get fixed.  But we did get a replacement car during that time. \\n- most evs are not quite as fun as a lightweight sports car and obviously no sound. Manual sports are still more fun. \\n\\nPros\\n- charging experience at home is amazing. I don't have a home charger and I just plug it into a normal plug. Get about 200km over night. Not needing to go fuel up is so good.  There is the obvious cost savings of charging at night.\\n- driving experience for commuting is amazing. Quiet, quick, effortless and basics self driving is awesome. \\n- instant torque is addictive. It's very difficult to go back to ice cars after getting used to instant torque. \\n- cheaper than equivalent ice, depending on what you value.  I'd argue for the same power, torque and comfort, you'd have to pay for for an ice car than an EV.  Not many 3 second 0 to 100 ice cars that's under $100k. Not many ice cars offer the same comfort and quietness for the same price. So Evs are simultaneously more expensive and cheaper.  The ora is now under 30k, which is cheaper than most ice cars of the same size. \\n- time saving, money saving and stress saving from the lack of service required. Had 1 service in 4 years and 1 wheel realignment.  Otherwise no issues. My last car was an Audi and that was a disaster even after 1 year. Previous car before that was a corolla and that also had issues over 5 years. Not a single issue with the model 3 so far. \\n- more interior space. EVs have way interior space and interior storage for the same size car. \\n- less break use. I love regen breaking now. It means that how much I press down the accelerator equals what speed I want. It's much more intuitive. \\n- salary packaging. Depending on your tax bracket, this would make EVs significantly cheaper. \\n\\n\\n\\nPersonally if you are mostly using the car for commuting and city driving. EVs are vastly superior. If you do lots of road trips then you might have to wait a few years for charging infrastructure to improve. \", 'If 15 years ago you looked at a XR6 Turbo Falcon or SS Commodore, being good sized cars, large powerful engines, relatively affordable, reliable and fairly cheap to run long term.\\n\\nWhat sort of cars would that car buyer look at now?

I believe that time is over and would highly recommend anyone with them to switch to another insurance company. (Do your own research) \\n\\nThe issues I\\'ve personally found with Shannons are the following: \\n\\n\\\\- Lack of \"enthusiasts\" as part of the process:   \\nI recently bought a new car and was looking into getting a quote to add the vehicle to my current policy with Shannons; a limited production, high performance sports car. Firstly I was put off by the curt \"okay\" I received when correcting the person on the phone regarding the engine the car had. I don\\'t know much about insurance, but I imagine there might be issues if the car was noted down as having the wrong engine! \\n\\nSecondly, I was further disappointed when I was told that my \"modern car\" could not be insured for an agreed upon value greater than what I paid for it, even though I got it at a good deal, as the system did not recognize that only 100 of them were ever sold in Australia! What kind of \"enthusiast\" insurance company does not take into account the limited production of a vehicle and only considers the age?   \\n\\n\\n\\\\- Poor policies:  \\nIn regards to their policy conditions, Shannons is behind even Budget Direct.   \\nShannons does not care that the car will be driven maybe 1000km a year, they only note down whether it\\'s driven daily, weekly, fortnightly, etc. Budget recognizes kilometers driven and lowers the price of the policy accordingly. In fact, most of the insurance company\\'s asked me what KM the car would be used for, rather than when it would be. Another strike against Shannons. \\n\\nFurther comparisons revealed that Shannons was more expensive than the average company, that wanted to insure it (disregarding the 6k-7,5k policies I got from QBE and Allianz) and provided less benefits than them. No over 25 excess, free towing, windscreens, etc can all be gotten from other company\\'s on a cheaper policy.   \\n\\n\\n\\\\- Poor value:  \\nA bit of rehash of the above two points, but an important one.   \\nIf you\\'re going to charge more than the competition and provide less benefits, you better provide better value at least...   \\nEnthusiast Insurance, NRMA and Budget Direct all gave me policies that were CHEAPER and provided me with a GREATER value than Shannons. So why would I even continue with Shannons? \\n\\nIn the end I\\'m moving my current car to Enthusiast Insurance and putting my new car on NRMA. Enthusiast won\\'t cover high powered cars for people under 30, but NRMA has great benefits so we\\'ll see what happens when I go to compare in the future.\\n\\nIn summary, the buyout of Shannons seems to have ripped the heart out of the company. They seem to rely on people not shopping around and making money off older people who keep their car garaged and are unlikely to claim. That\\'s fine, Enthusiast Insurance and everyone else does it too, but the cost of the insurance vs the value provided has certainly tipped the scales. \\n\\nIf you have a modified car, I join a lot of car people on reddit and recommend Enthusiast Insurance.   \\nHopefully NRMA is okay. ', \"Seing all the bashing that MG got the other day I'm interesting to see what all of you guys think about haval. By all of you, I mean people who actually know, have tried, or own an haval, not people that thought the same of kia and hyundai 10 years ago. Go to this post with open mind and not hate just because it is chinese.\\n\\nBefore I get to my 1 year expierence here's why I bought it. I'm a big car guy since I was a kid and would've never touched a chinese brand in my life, but here I am, 1 year ago, researching haval.\\n\\nAfter the h2, which is a knock off of european cars, they re-created themself into building actual and proper cars. They hired ex german engineers to build the new cars, jolion, h6, tank. The 2022 cars engines are 3-5 years behind modern standards. The 2023 hybrid models are on par with the previous generation toyota engines. Interiors, absolutely no rivals in the price category, build quality, absolutely no rivals in the price category, features, absolutely no rivals in the price category, availability 2 months at max, rivals, more than a year (i wanted a rav 4), warranty, road assistance, capped services. So, after I test drove a sportage, tucson and the seltos, I test drove the jolion and h6. Right out of the gate, you don't see the $10-20k price difference of the other brand. In my opinion, I thought the opposite, the havals should've been $10-20k more. While the h6 has a better snappier engine I chose the jolion as I didn't need a huge car.\\n\\nOrder the car in November 21 and arrived in January 22. Paid $28k for the lux version. When it arrived the price was already up, $30k (it is now $31k). \\n\\nAfter one year and 13.000 kms the review is in and: by far the best purchase I have ever done.\\n\\nPro:\\n- The car drives well in any condition I used it for, urban, trips, holiday.\\n- All the features makes you feel you're driving a modern car. Most of the time it drive itself, I just rest my hands on the sterring wheel. \\n- The engine is more than enough for the speed limits that are in Australia, it drinks a bit but it goes fine.  \\n- Lots of space\\n\\nCons:\\n- it needs setups. You need to go to every single menu and setup all the settings otherwise it is going to beep for anything. \\n- the only problem I had was a faulty battery at 300kms and racv came and replaced it in under 1hr, all included in the road assistance. (The guy said that a lot of them have this fault when they arrive from China.)\\n\\nNow, on the complaints that I read about haval in this subreddit:\\n\\n- Chinese: i feel you, but I don't feel in a chinese car while driving\\n- build quality: for all of you saying it is shit, please go have a test ride\\n- interior build quality and features: same as before, let me know if you find anything even remotely closer below 50k.\\n- Parts: at my service, I requested to swap the blades and they had it. Not sure what happens with big parts if you crash, but also, if you don't live in the bush, you can see how many they're sellling on the road, it will be ridiculous to not have parts.\\n- Any second hand car is better: you guys are dreaming.\\n- depreciation: there are huge claims in this subreddit about massive depreciation up to 50%. In reality, these cars are new and people are buying it. So, after 1.5 years that they have been on the market, the retail price is going up and couldn't find one below 25k on carsales.com.au.\\n- how it drives: it is a small suv, works as small suv, drives like a small suv. It is not a race car, or a sports car, and it is perfectly fine for under 110km/hrs. If we were in Europe with speed limits of 130 then I would reconsider.\\n\\nFeel free to ask any questions\\n\\nEDIT: for all the angry people I never said that it is the best car in the world. I'm only saying my expierience is different from what I read here and that after 1 year I think it is an amazing car for the price. In the future, it may rust, it may explode or whatever. Will get back to say it is trash.

I've usually bought new. Half this stuff is done under goodwill warranty.  \\n\\nWe live on a rural property with about 700 meters of unsealed but graded driveway, and then its bitumen.  Maybe do 10000 kms a year if that with each vehicle.  I don't flog the vehicles or smash the 4WDs through hard 4WDing.  Religiously get servicing done by a meticulous mechanic who uses OEM parts, one of the reasons we've been able to get goodwill warranties. Fuck me though, I'm sick of the lemons.  I've yet to hit 100k with a vehicle without serious expensive shit happening in the last 20 years.\\n\\nI need to get a new SUV car.  Thinking of hybrids and particularly PHEV appeals to me as we do about 40kms in a day and the idea of electric reliability is attractive, but I want fuel reserves for regional journeys.  But some of that tech is still fresh and reviews only look at new cars, not cars 50k/100k down the road.  Our mechanic has his recommendations: Toyota and Hyundai.  But I'm interested in getting a broader consensus.  What's out there that is worth looking at? \\n\\nCheers\", \"Need suggestions for the best used car under 20k that is very reliable. Vehicle must be a sedan and under 70k kilometres. Currently interested in the corolla, Camry, Kia Cerato, Mazda 3, Mazda 6(if I'm lucky). Vehicle can be hybrid aswell. \\n\\nAlso used car prices are up 15%-20% at the moment. So don't mind if it goes a bit over budget.\", 'Everyone recommends Toyota/Mazda/Honda because they are reliable.\\n\\nAnd people want reliable cars to save money.\\n\\nBut everyone on the used car market knows this, so all the reliable brands cost an extra 30 percent on the used market.\\n\\nLet me give you an example.\\n\\nUsed Skoda Octavia 2017 wagon is 16k on cars24 with 100,000k. It has android auto, radar cruise etc.\\n\\nMeanwhile a Camry 2017 on cars24 with similar kilometers is 20k. Yes it\\'s technically a size category higher but the Octavia has a larger boot and similar legroom. The Toyota is also missing android auto, radar cruise etc.\\n\\nIt\\'s gonna take a long time to make back the 4k you lost at time of purchase due to \"reliability\" savings. If you buy a less reliable brand you can put the savings in the bank account and use it for unexpected repairs.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying to avoid the reliable brands, I\\'m just pointing out that sometimes a less reliable brand can save you significant money up front, and often the less reliable brands have a lot more features at a particular age of car (e.g. German cars usually have things like android auto/radar cruise much earlier on compared to Japanese cars).\\n\\nIn reality as I was cross shopping the Camry and Octavia, I would have to get the 2019 Camry to get android auto, radar cruise etc which is more like 22k. And the cheapest corolla with android auto was 2021 for 22k on cars24.\\n\\nI also have seen there are some under the radar brands which are reliable but not associated with reliability. A lot of ford models like the Mondeo have a really good reputation for reliability but are priced way under Toyota/Mazda/Honda on the used market because everyone is just told \"buy Japanese\".\\n\\nIf unexpected expenses are gonna stress you out then yeh stick to Toyota but I think it\\'s worth considering how of a premium you are paying for that reliability on the used market, since everyone already knows that these brands are reliable.\\n\\n', 'So now I have driven or attempted to drive the 3 American utes officially on sale in the base model.\\n\\nThe F150 XLT, the RAM 1500 Express, and the Chevrolet Silverado LTZ\\n\\nNow I say attempted to drive because the F150 has been impossible to test drive around the [turbocharger recall](https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/ford-f-150-sales-and-deliveries-halted-after-remanufacturing-fault), the [steering recall](https://www.drive.com.au/news/australian-ford-f-150-owners-told-to-stop-driving-due-to-steering-failure-risk/) and the [clock spring recall](https://www.drive.com.au/news/2023-ford-f-150-recalled-in-australia/) so Ford is running at an average recall of 1 nearly every 3 weeks since the launch of the new model, so I\\'m not as confident in getting a test drive, especially as I have been waiting since [September 2023 for the F150 to get here](https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/ford-australias-f-150-superseded-before-it-even-reaches-showrooms)\\n\\nAt this point I\\'ve decided that I\\'m not even going to consider the F150 as they seem to have some very serious reliability issues. For something touted as the \"best truck in the world\" and the \"most popular truck in the world\", I\\'m not sure how people look past the reliability issues.\\n\\nHonestly, I wanted to make what the go was so I asked on r/Ford trucks, r/F150, r/Ford, and r/Trucks, instead I just got people blatantly saying that there hadn\\'t been these recalls and that their truck is the best truck.\\n\\nThis also excludes the Toyota Tundra because [although it\\'s officially in Australia, it\\'s not confirmed that it\\'s going to be sold in Australia](https://www.toyota.com.au/news/toyota-tundra-customer-evaluation-program-kicks-off) and it\\'s impossible to get a drive of.\\n\\nSo that leaves the two trucks that you can physically get your hands on, get in, and drive.\\n\\nThat\\'s the RAM 1500 Express and the Chevrolet Silverado LTZ, and I have to say.\\n\\nThe price difference between the base models is eye watering, $97,000 for the RAM and $147,000 for the Silverado is insane.\\n\\nBut.\\n\\nThe Silverado is definitely significantly nicer than the RAM, I would say it\\'s much closer to the RAM Laramie than it is to the Express, but the Laramie isn\\'t the base model, where the LTZ is.\\n\\nThe RAM, even in the Laramie trim is louder, has less features, and the fact that it can\\'t tow 4,500kg on a gooseneck is worrying in itself. RAM Australia has said that if you fit a Gooseneck, you immediately void all chassis and drivetrain warranties simply by having one fitted.\\n\\nWhich is interesting, because Goosenecks are more stable and offer significantly better weight distribution across axle groups over a traditional bumper pull setup. So it\\'s interesting that they say you can\\'t do it, and that it\\'s not rated.\\n\\nI have seen Ford Rangers and Hiluxes pulling Goosenecks before, if a fucking Ranger can do it, why can\\'t a RAM?\\n\\nThe features you get between the two are chalk and cheese, the Silverado has heated and cooled seats, adaptive cruise, lane keep, 360° Camera, and so on.\\n\\nThe RAM seems to be practically a whole generation behind in features, and the RAM dealer seemed to be more of a \"You get what you get\" type person rather than involve any conversation on the competition. Basically \"You buy this, or you buy that, I won\\'t discuss the differences or say why mine is better\"\\n\\n\"Basic\" (modern car) features that the Chevrolet has and the Ram are missing include Adaptive cruise control, Lane Keep Assistance, 360° Camera, Multiple Reversing Camera Angles, Remote Start, and rear USB charging ports.\\n\\nFrom a purely driving perspective, the Chevrolet sits in the lane better, it has much more direct feel on the steering, and not once did I run out of power driving it. Even towing, if I reached for that right pedal, it was there.\\n\\nAlso, GMSV let me have the car for 36 hours to live with, and that allowed me to do a trip to Hammerbarn, it let me go to the tip and take rubbish, it let me get in Highway time, it let me get city time, I got to park it and live with it.\\n\\nRAM was \"Let\\'s run around the block, 20 minute, in town, 5 minutes on the highway \"\\n\\nI feel that Ran tried to hold onto \"We\\'re first in the market\" for too long, and then GM and Ford came in with a much better product.\\n\\nIf I\\'m going from a 79 Series to a 1500 Express, sure, the 1500 Express seems like a great car.\\n\\nBut anything with a little bit of tech, the 1500 Express is a step backwards.\\n\\nI\\'m super disappointed for all the hype and everything on the F150, I just can\\'t see why it\\'s so popular when it\\'s practically unavailable to test drive due to recalls for months on end. Makes you wonder, you drop $140,000+ on one, how much time is it gonna be in the workshop or off the road due to faults?\\n\\nAesthetically, the F150 is by far my favourite, and from sitting in it, although not being allowed to drive, it is my favourite for the cabin layout.\\n\\nHonestly, after what GM did in the shutdown of Holden, I genuinely never thought I would look towards another GM product, but it seems that they have the best on the market.\\n\\nFinally, with the Silverado I got to actually experience loving with the car.\\n\\n1) Why the fuck do some people take up 4 car spaces to park the cunt? It\\'s not that big.\\n\\n2) Why do so many people in Hiluxes and rangers pull up next to you on the highway and rev the cunt out of their car and speed past you?\\n\\n3) Why do people say they are \"fuel guzzling\"? I averaged 12.5l/100 mixed Highway and Inner City, previously my utes have done around 12.3-12.8l/100km and that\\'s been a Hilux, a Ranger, and a T60. So it seems on par with economy to smaller utes.\\n\\n4) Why isn\\'t it possible to get this level of comfort in a Ranger or Hilux? This is simply proof that you can build a good comfortable ute that also doubles as a work vehicle and yet no other manufacturers seem to do it in the smaller utes.\\n\\n5) Why is this in the Jeep Gladiator the only utes on the market to have a sunroof?\\n\\n6) Why is a 12 pin trailer plug not standard? So useful.\\n\\n7) Why are electric brakes not standard on other utes, they\\'re included in the Chev and the RAM, why keep a safety device out of other utes?\\n\\n8) Why don\\'t other utes have a HUD standard in the base model?\\n\\nI mean, I have to say, the Silverado is probably the single best appointed base model ute available in Australia when you compare features, capabilities, and price. It\\'s actually pretty good value.\\n\\nIt\\'s still stupid expensive, but when you compare it in price to a GR Landcruiser 300 Series, you\\'re getting more shit, and more capabilities, for less money.', 'small city hatches used to be less than 16k entry level. but for a brand new one , the city hatchback that was economical and can fit tight spaces. only option is mg 3 or kia picanto above 20k when it hits road ( thanks dealers) in sydney. why are govt talking about environment and also allowing gigantic gas guzzlers. and still stopping the small cars. now they can freely import cars from anywhere in the world with legislation. the cars importers are also charging upwards of 15k to 20k for a used one. what is the way around for this situation.', 'I’m debating whether to buy a new or relatively new used Mustang.

Here's a breakdown:\\n\\n ##What it covers:\\n\\nInjuries to others: CTP primarily covers bodily injury or death caused to other people in a car accident. This includes:\\n\\n1)Other drivers\\n2) Passengers in other vehicles\\n3) Pedestrians\\n4) Cyclists\\n5) Motorcyclists\\n\\n##What it doesn't cover:\\n\\n1)Damage to vehicles or property: It does not cover damage to your own vehicle, the other driver's vehicle, or any other property.\\n2) Your own injuries: It doesn't cover your own medical expenses or lost income if you are injured in an accident.\\n\\n##How it works:\\n\\n1) Mandatory: You must have valid CTP insurance to register your vehicle in Australia.\\n\\n2) State variations: The specific rules and regulations regarding CTP insurance can vary slightly between Australian states and territories.\\n\\nIncluded in registration: In some states, the cost of CTP is included in your vehicle registration fees. In others, you need to purchase it separately from a licensed insurer.\\n\\n\\nKey Points:\\nCTP insurance is essential for all vehicle owners in Australia.\\n\\nIt provides crucial financial protection for others who may be injured in an accident caused by you.\\n\\nIt is important to understand the specific rules and coverage limits that apply in your state.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This information is for general knowledge and guidance only. It is not a substitute for professional legal or financial advice.\\n\\nI recommend contacting your state's road transport authority or an insurance broker for the most up-to-date and accurate information on CTP insurance in Australia.\\n\\n#Self Insurance (Uninsured)\\n\\nSelf-insurance means that instead of paying premiums to an insurance company, an individual or entity assumes the financial responsibility for potential losses themselves.\\n\\n##How it works:\\n\\n1) You set aside a specific amount of money (often in a reserve fund) to cover potential losses.\\n\\n2) When a loss occurs (like a car accident, medical expense, or property damage), you pay for it out-of-pocket from your reserves.\\n\\n##Pros:\\n\\n1) Potential cost savings: If losses are lower than expected, you can save money compared to insurance premiums.\\n2) Greater control: You have more control over claim decisions and how your funds are used.\\n\\n##Cons:\\n\\n1) Significant financial risk: You bear the full financial burden of any losses, which could be substantial.\\n\\n2) Requires careful financial planning: You need to accurately assess potential risks and ensure you have sufficient reserves.\\n\\nIn essence, self-insurance is a risk management strategy where you take on the financial responsibility for potential losses rather than transferring that risk to an insurance company.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This is a simplified explanation. Self-insurance can be complex and involves various legal and financial considerations.\\n\\n#Third Party Property & Legal Liability\\n\\nIn Australia, Third Party Property & Legal Liability insurance in the context of motor vehicles primarily covers the costs of damage you cause to someone else's vehicle or property while driving.\\n\\n\\nFocus: Primarily covers financial losses incurred by others due to your driving.\\n\\n##Key Coverage:\\n\\n1) Damage to another person's vehicle.\\n2) Damage to other people's property (fences, buildings, etc.).\\n3) Legal Liability: Helps cover legal costs if you are sued by someone for property damage caused by your vehicle.\\n\\n***Important Note: This type of insurance does not cover damage to your own vehicle.***\\n\\nKey Differences from Compulsory Third Party (CTP) Insurance:\\n\\n1) CTP is mandatory in all Australian states and territories.\\n2) CTP focuses on covering bodily injury or death to another person caused by your vehicle.\\n\\nThird Party Property & Legal Liability insurance provides crucial financial protection for you if you accidentally cause damage to someone else's property while driving. It's a valuable addition to your overall car insurance coverage.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This is a general overview and may not cover all specific situations or variations in policy terms.\\n\\nAlways refer to your policy documents or consult with an insurance professional for detailed information.\\n\\nSome third party liability coverage will provide a minor level of cover if you are hit by a self-insured/uninsured driver and may also provide some level of cover in the case your vehicle is damaged in a fire or it is stolen, This is not standard across all policies and may be an optional extra on top of the basic cover. \\n\\n#Comprehensive Insurance\\n\\nComprehensive motor vehicle insurance in Australia provides the broadest coverage for your vehicle. It typically covers:\\n\\n1) Damage to your vehicle: This includes accidents, fire, theft, natural disasters (storms, floods, hail), and vandalism.\\n2) Third-party property damage: Covers damage you cause to other vehicles or property.\\n3) Legal Liability coverage for the chats of legal fees\\n\\nOptional extras: These can include things like roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement, and personal accident cover.\\n\\nAgreed Value vs. Market Value:\\n\\n##Agreed Value:\\n\\nYou and the insurer agree on the value of your vehicle at the time of policy inception. If your vehicle is declared a total loss, you receive the agreed-upon amount, regardless of its market value at the time of the claim. This is beneficial for classic, vintage, or modified cars that may be worth more than their market value.\\n\\n##Market Value:\\n\\nThe insurance company pays you the market value of your vehicle at the time of the loss. This is determined by factors like age, condition, mileage, and current market prices.\\n\\nImportant Note: Comprehensive insurance usually does not cover wear and tear, mechanical breakdowns, or damage caused by driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This is a general overview. Always refer to your specific policy documents for detailed coverage information and exclusions\\n\\n#Key Notes:\\n\\nA lot of insurance policies will not cover you in the event that you are operating a vehicle illegally \\n\\nSo if your vehicle is not compliant with roadworthiness requirements in your state or territory, Or in the event your vehicle needs engineering And it does not have it, Then a claim can be denied. \\n\\nAlthough this does not come into play in every claim, this will certainly be a factor if the part of your vehicle that is unroadworthy or has been modified illegally is the cause of the accident or contributes to the accident being more severe. \\n\\nClaims can also be declined if you are speeding or driving in a manner that is dangerous or charged with some dangerous driving offences, however, this is less common.\\n\\nIn the event that you are operating the vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol, this can also void a policy. \\n\\nNot all insurance policies will cover you if you are off-road or on private property, however, some will cover you in the case that you are in an area you are legally allowed to be \\n\\nSome insurance policies will place driver restrictions on the policy, meaning that only listed drivers can drive it, And some policies will place a household restriction that everyone that lives in the same residence as yourself is required to be listed on the policy. \\n\\nEver since the banking royal commission in Australia, insurance companies are legally required to insure only the financial owner of the vehicle, meaning that if you are not the financial owner, it is insurance fraud to take out insurance on something that you do not own. \\n\\nThis is an incredibly common tactic where parents will insure a car that is owned by their children in order to avoid higher premiums and bring the cost of insurance policies down. \\n\\nInsurance fraud is a criminal offence in Australia, And if you are caught conducting insurance fraud, you can face jail time and incredibly large fines, And this may impact you in the future if you try and purchase another financial product such as insurance or obtain a bank loan. \\n\\nFor at least of insurance companies that may be able to offer you cover you can go to https://www.findaninsurer.com.au/ which is a service run by the insurance Council of Australia.\\n\\nIf you need to make a complaint to the ombudsman for the insurance industry you can go to https://www.afca.org.au/ And logic complaint there with the ombudsman \\n\\nHowever, be aware that in order to have AFCA look at your case, you generally need to go through the complaints process for your insurance provider prior to raising this to the ombudsman \\n\\nThis subreddit takes a dim view on people recommending insurance fraud, any comments on this subreddit or any posts requesting for advice on how to commit insurance fraud will result in the post being removed \\n\\nFurther posts on the matter pertaining to advice on how to commit insurance fraud or request on how to commit insurance fraud will result in you being banned from this subreddit.\", 'I am looking to buy a car to keep long term (meaning keeping it till it dies). \\n\\nI do not want a SUV as the driving dynamics are extremely boring except maybe the Cupra Formentor. \\n\\nI want a car that handles well in corners, not just fast in a straight line.\\n\\nI have looked at the following cars-\\n\\nI30N sedan.

Lived without a car for 9 months to try save money but life in regional NSW was getting difficult without one so i borrowed $4,500 from my boyfriend to buy a car.\\n\\nDid my research on the most reliable car possible, couldnt afford an old Toyota Corolla (i.e. going for $7,000+ and 200,000+ kms in my area), heard Honda was the next best and saw a used 250,000km 2004 Honda CRV in Sydney for $4,700. Paid a mechanic $300 to do a pre purchase inspection. No major issues identified, he recommended that its a reliable car and would only take a couple grand to fix some small stuff. Took to a mechanic in my home town. Told me theres heaps of issues but \"it\\'s a Honda so it\\'ll last forever\". 4 pages of issues and $5000 in repairs later (boyfriend loaned more money), and it breaks down again. Words from the mechanic \"Head gasket leaking into the sump, possibly wet the spark plugs, thats why it wont start. Water in the combustion chambers. Blown head gasket. Not worth fixing. Roughly $6000 to fix\"\\n\\nBroke. Owe by boyfriend $10K for a car that doesnt work. Need a car. Can\\'t trust any mechanics. Got stitched up by the seller + pre purchase inspection mechanic + second mechanic was nice but can\\'t understand why it took $5,000 worth of work to tell me it\\'s not worth repairing anymore?\\n\\nWhat would you do? Cut your losses and move on? Try get some repair money back from the pre-purchase inspection mechanic? Any tips or advice greatly appreciated.\\n\\n  \\nUPDATE: Thankyou so much for the advice and insight, i appreciate it so much. Shame to hear it sounds like i\\'ve been taken for a run by mechanic #2 also with the $6000 quote / $5000 of work. I\\'ve contacted mechanic #1 and they seem quite concerned with the lack of detail in their employee\\'s pre purchase inspection so i\\'m going to try get them to try solve as much of this as possible. If not, then i\\'ll speak to NSW Fair Trading re false advertising for what \\'they offer\\' in a pre purchase inspection. I\\'ve booked in to a few different mechanics to quote for the work required. Will make a decision on next steps after this. Plan to cut my loses and ride my bike until i can get a novated lease on a newer toyota or similar. Will never buy an old car again 🥲 Understand i sound very dumb by this whole predicament but have been greatly naive with cars given i\\'ve had 10+ years of great experiences with buying used cars but must have had a lucky run with decent sellers / mechanics until now. Thanks again. ', \"Hello,\\n\\nI am currently looking for a car within a budget of $35K.

Have a great day. \\n\", 'I will preface this with *I am a beginner track day enthusiast. I’m not the best or very fast but my goal is to improve my driving and have fun in a controlled environment. I have done beginner drift days and skid pan days in the past as well as try to work on my own cars as much as possible. \\n\\nSo I’m writing this as a lot of people think you need a car with 500hp and every modification under the sun to do a track day. Repeat with me “6 pot brakes do not make you stop faster” and hoping to encourage more people to give it a go.\\n\\nAll you need is a cheap but RELIABLE platform with some sort of aftermarket support or be good at making stuff. Manual gearbox is a must if you have a slow car like the trusty jazz. And it’s heaps more fun. We bought ours at 202,000km and incomplete service history. Changed the fluids and spark plugs and that’s it.\\n\\nGood budget platforms can be stuff like the Jazz, Toyota Echo Sportivo, Hyundai Excel, Yaris , Swift and Swift sport , there are some euro ones if you’d like to take a gamble like Renault Clio etc. before you commit to a nugget I would research if you can get A) good suspension to bolt in B) easy to find brake pads.\\n\\nIf you have a budget of more than $5k for just the car then you can get ratty mx5s and Civics etc for $8-10k which are a better platform to begin with but not needed.\\n\\nNow you have a Nuggét, these are the things you need to do a track day.\\n\\nTyres - Hankook RS4 should be the baseline tyre. They’re cheap $550 for 4 for 3 on special. RE003s and Pilot sports won’t cut it in the dry, you’ll probably overheat them. Tyres are your most important purchase , they will dictate your grip and braking performance.\\n\\nBrake pads - upgraded brake pads and OEM discs. You don’t need slotted or drilled. We use EBC yellow in the Jazz. Probably not the best pad for track use but we were in a time pinch and they are so far so good. Lots of people use Winmax W3 or Hawk. You’ll have to do some research for your own preference. \\n\\nBrake fluid - high temp brake fluid, we use Motul 600 RBF. Flush out your old fluid and put this in. Bleed the brakes. Enjoy not boiling the fluid when you brake hard after a few laps.\\n\\nFire extinguisher - Mounted on a metal bracket where the driver can reach. $40 extinguisher and bracket maybe $30-40? Free or cheap if you can make one.\\n\\nHelmet - Motorcycle helmets are usually okay but check the organisers rules. Car helmets sometimes have extra things for HANS devices. You can pick up one from $150 all the way up to $3k decide how much your head is worth. \\n\\nTyre deflator and inflator - You’ll want to check your tyre pressure after each session as cold and hot pressures will change a lot. I was told to aim for about 30psi hot. So I usually start the day at about 25/26psi cold and keep checking.\\n\\nWheel alignment - make sure your car is driving as it should and the suspension geometry is okay.\\n\\nAASA Motorsport day license $25 ish dollars. You need one of these to drive. You can also buy a yearly one if you plan to do more than a few events.\\n\\nThats it if you want to do it on a real budget. Make sure the car has no leaks, the brakes work, no loose items in the car and book in your first event!\\n\\nIf you enjoyed your first track day you can do more to your car! Because maybe you’ve been bit by the track bug.\\n\\nSeat - A racing seat will help tremendously in the corners, make sure you get reputable brand seats and high quality mounts.\\n\\nSuspension upgrades , coilovers, sway bars. Camber kits etc. This is where you can start spending money depending on how crazy you want to get.\\n\\nFor me I went with BC racing DS series with custom spring rates, basically following Honed Developments suspension recipe. (This is why it’s helpful to pick up a car that’s been tested).\\n\\nAnd that’s pretty much it!

It was the sixth generation Ford Falcon and also included the Ford Fairmont (AU)—the luxury-oriented model range. The AU series replaced the EL Falcon and was constructed on the (at the time) new EA169 platform which continued to harbour Falcon models until 2010 when the BF wagon was discontinued, and Ford Territory models until 2011. The AU series was replaced by the updated BA series.\\n\\nThe AU series was conceived under *Project Eagle* that begun in February 1993, and gained the official codename *EA169* in October 1994. It was developed and brought to market in 1998 only after Ford Australia had given consideration to a revamped fifth generation Falcon and a fully imported replacement such as the American front-wheel drive Ford Taurus or rear-wheel drive Ford Crown Victoria, the European rear wheel-drive Scorpio and, reportedly, even the Japanese rear-wheel drive Mazda 929 (then part of the Ford conglomerate).\\n\\nThe above alternatives were eliminated in favour of a substantial redesign of the indigenous platform, due to concerns about the Australian market preference for high towing capacity, large interior size and local employment. Specific factors included, for example: research at the time indicated that 69% of Falcons were fitted with towbars and the perception that rear-wheel drive cars were better at towing; the fact that the import models had limited body style options (sedan only or sedan and wagon) and no capability to use a V8 engine.\\n\\nStylistically, this new generation Falcon sported Ford\\'s radically new global design language, labelled \"New Edge\". The aim of this design was to attract a younger generation of buyers with avant-garde looks, however, in Australia it polarized public opinion to the benefit of the more organically designed rival, the 1997 Holden Commodore (VT). The AU series had a very efficient drag coefficient of Cd=0.295 for the sedan (an 11% improvement over the preceding EL series) and 0.34 for the wagon.\\n\\nFor the first time in Falcon\\'s history, Independent Rear Suspension (IRS) became available as standard on some models and optional on others. It also featured Australian production firsts, such as Variable Cam Timing (VCT) on some 6-cylinder models and an adaptive automatic transmission on the high-performance T series with steering wheel gear shifting buttons.\\n\\nKey changes from the fifth generation Falcon included a 35 kg (77 lb) reduction in weight for the base car, 17.5 per cent stiffer bodyshell, and an eight per cent improvement in fuel consumption. Peculiarly, Ford Australia decided to use the original 1950\\'s font for the new \"Falcon\" and \"Futura\" badges.\\n\\nAs stated previously, the AU was the first Falcon to offer IRS (a double wishbone design on an isolated subframe). IRS was made available as a costly option on the base Forte, Fairmont and \\'S\\' models, and standard on Fairmont Ghia, XR6 VCT and XR8 models. The updated 6-cylinder engines incorporated advanced features such as VCT on some models and a temperature sensor in the cylinder head, which detected coolant loss and allowed the car to \"limp home\" safely by cutting cylinders. The engine range comprised: the base Intech model producing 157 kW (211 hp), with a revised cylinder head featuring smaller valve stems, larger exhaust valves, and different rocker ratio, as well as a revised piston and longer conrod and a cast aluminium cross-bolted oil sump (with the same power output as the EL series); an \"HP\" version reserved to the XR6 producing 164 kW (220 hp) (thanks to: unique cylinder head; reshaped inlet port; redesigned exhaust port; ‘open’ combustion chamber shape to restrict pre-detonation from hot spot areas; unique camshaft; higher fuel pressure; recalibrated EEC V engine management system); the VCT version producing 172 kW (231 hp) for the XR6 VCT; a *Windsor V8* producing 185 kW (248 hp) (also carried over from the EL series but without major upgrades).\\n\\nTransmissions were improved for better shift feel and the auto was recalibrated to better suit the upgraded engines. The six and eight cylinder models had a 4-speed BTR M93LE and M97LE automatic transmission, respectively. The automatic XR series models had an \"adaptive shift\" with five shifting strategies depending on driving conditions. The manual transmission, where available, was a 5-speed T5 model.\\n\\nThe program cost A$700 million before product launch and key staff included chief designer, Steve Park, and Marcus Hotblack, Manager of Interior Design.\\n\\nFor more information, please see the following:\\n\\n[AU Falcon Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Falcon_(AU))\\n\\n[Shannons Club - Has the AU Falcon become better with age?](https://www.shannons.com.au/club/forum/general/has-the-au-falcon-become-better-with-age/)\\n\\n[Top Gearbox - Ford\\'s Unloved Child - The AU Falcon](https://www.topgearbox.com/cars/entertainment/motoringbox/172877-views%E2%80%A2sep-5-2019-5-6k-140-share-save-motoringbox-16-7k-subscribers-today-were-looking-at-one-of-the-most-infamous-cars-to-ever-come-out-of-australia-a-car-which-has-generated/)\\n\\n[Trade Unique Cars - AU Falcon Buyers Guide](https://www.tradeuniquecars.com.au/buyers-guide/2001/2000-2002-ford-falcon-au-bfii-xr8-buyers-guide)\\n\\n[Australian Car Reviews - AU Falcon Buyers Guide](http://australiancar.reviews/reviews.php#!content=guide&make=Ford&model=Falcon&gen=237)\\n\\n[ProductReview - AU Falcon Product Reviews](https://www.productreview.com.au/listings/ford-falcon-au-1998-2002)\\n\\n[CarSales - All AU Falcons for sale in Australia](https://www.carsales.com.au/cars/?q=(And.Service.carsales._.(C.Make.Ford._.(C.Model.Falcon._.(Or.Series.AU._.Series.AU+II._.Series.AU+III.))))&sort=%7ePrice)\\n\\n*I am a human, and this action was performed manually.', 'Hi,\\nMe (21) and my girlfriend (25) is looking to get a car under 30.000$, since we do not know anything about cars, we are looking to get a reliable new car.

Used prices still look too high. Was defaulting to Sorrento/SantaFe etc.\\n\\nSee that with many dealers, Skoda Kodiaqs are now 45k for a new base model with 6-7 years warranty left (ie late MY23 or MY24 with a 2024 rego date) and you can probably negotiate a bit off.  Many examples with 0-500km. And they have 2.99% financing: we could pay cash but this is a no-brainer to keep money in offset and set aside money for the balloon payment. Can get a sportline or optioned Style for 50k, although I don’t think you need any of that.\\n\\nWhy would I pay 15-20k more for a well-specced Rav 4 or a Santa Fe, or other examples? That’s equivalent to a massive holiday? I know Skoda depreciation is terrible but we will hold for at least a couple of years outside warranty. We will be low mileage, service on time, etc. - Skodas are considered reliable outside Australia and we are VIC so can go to a few dealers or independents if a dealer stuffs us around. Servicing is a little more but other savings like financing even that out - and I’m saving 10-20k upfront. \\n\\nI know something like a Rav 4 or even Santa Fe will last longer; but if the Skoda has 7 years of warranty life and then at least a few years with expensive repairs - it seems bizarre to spend 10-20k more on the expectation of usage in over a decade?

I think the AU Falcon is possibly the fugliest shit stain to grace Australian roads this side of a SsangYong Stavic, though I do have fond memories of my friend’s not-quite-so-fugly XD with its agricultural 4-speed manual and non-power assisted steering, which made trying to hurry it a physical work-out and near-death experience. I very much like a Barra swap.\\n\\nI’ve been to the odd hill-climb, rally, track day (as a spectator), and car show over the last 20 years. I’ve mainly owned hot hatches, including a Peugeot GTI6, Golf MK6 GTI, Renault Clio 172 Sport, Renault Megane RS265, BMW M135i (2013).\\n\\nI’m comfortable doing basic maintenance myself, such as oil and filter changes, discs and pads. My step dad is a retired mechanic with a hoist in his back yard, and I’ve assisted with more complex jobs, like engine mounts and auxiliary belts.\\n\\nI currently own a 2013 Mazda 6 Wagon, a 2004 Subaru Forester SG9 STI and a Tesla Model 3 Long Range with the acceleration boost.\\n\\nI think Elon Musk is a bit of a dickhead. On a good day.\\n\\nBesides the Tesla, the most powerful car I’ve driven was my friend’s 2007 AMG S63. (386KW, 630NM)\\n\\nWith that context behind us, let’s begin.\\n\\nSo… I really loved the M135i. Until the big end bearings went on the N55 with less than 100,000km. I’d owned it since 42,000km, always religiously maintained it, including in that time, 2 rocker cover and gasket replacements (fucking plastic rocker covers that warp and leak), radiator replacement, oil leak fixes from near turbo and oil filter, replacement charge pipe (again plastic, WTF), and the usual consumables such as brakes and tyres.\\n\\nAn engine replacement with a second hand N55 was going to cost $15K. A rebuild likely above and beyond. I think an N55 crank was alone going to be 3K, let alone rods, pistons and what ever else it needed, plus labour. (If you’re about to comment, “jusT Throw In sOme neW BeArings anD sell it”, you’re a cunt. Go fuck yourself.)\\n\\nI read people talk about the S58 being reliable… Shit, maybe within warranty… BMW, love your cars, but never again…\\n\\nAnyway, I digress…\\n\\nThis was during 2020, I was out of work due to COVID and sold my baby, broken, for $15K, sucked it up and found the most reliable family car I could within my budget: a 2013 Mazda 6 wagon with 65,000KM. \\n\\nMy wife loved it. Anonymous. Instantly, people acted less like dickheads, let you merge. Stopped trying to race you. We still have it.\\n\\nI still had my RS265, which was a great car. Absolutely zero issues over 3 years. French reliability. Still the best handling car I’ve ever driven. FWD haters have no idea. Yes, traction off the line was something to be managed, but on the road, the chassis balance was in another league.\\n\\nI took a full-time job, saved some money, and after some man maths, a few months working on my wife, we test drove a Tesla Model 3 Long Range. The instant torque, 0-100 in 4.4 seconds felt like a cheat code. People talk about 0-100 times of other cars, but forget, that’s with launch control. The Tesla does it all day, every day, just by pressing the pedal. Real world, there are very few cars that come close.\\n\\nI bought the car at just under $79K. The most I’d ever spent before was 50. It was a stretch, but $30K down and financing the rest at 1.99% over 4 years and a balloon of about $23K works out to $155 a week.\\n\\nIn the BMW and the Megane, I averaged around 12L per 100km. Must be the way I drive, but I don’t know why you buy a performance car if you’re trying to be fuel efficient. With solar, charging during the day (about $1200 to buy and install the wall connector) basically means no fuel costs, and maintenance is also just tyres, brakes, etc. So my moderate man maths calls this $3K savings a year, or $15K over 5 years, bringing the cost down to around $65K. I also feel the resale will be better than average at \\\\~$40k+. I’m sure you’ll tell me why I’m wrong in the comments, but considering the TCO of the BMW, I feel I’m ahead. 😊\\n\\nDriving wise, it handles really well. Like *really* well. The weight is low and the steering is super direct and confidence inspiring, though not a lot of feel. The torque out of the corners is biblical. I bought the acceleration boost ($3K) the day it became available, dropping the 0-100 to 3.9 seconds. Quarter mile in 11.9. It is fucking absurdly quick. It has a 10ms torque response, meaning you have \\\\~650NM of torque at any speed delivered in 1/100th of a second. There is nothing faster you can buy bang for buck.\\n\\nTraction control with electric motors is superb. You can get a modicum of rear biased turn in on throttle (the rear *will* kick out), but no smoky burnouts, and the front also does voodoo to pull you into line.\\n\\nI hear people parrot that there’s ‘no soul’, but I suspect they haven’t actually driven one and are just talking out their arse. It is a fun car.\\n\\nThe one thing I hate are the seats – they need more side bolstering. Also, yes, touch screens are not the best choice for all controls.\\n\\nBesides driving, what I love: the stereo is seriously excellent; the glass roof is cool, and heated seats and steering wheel are lovely in winter.\\n\\nI’ve driven it from Brisbane to Sydney, used the Tesla charger network and it was fine. About 20 to 25 minutes a stop to charge from 40% to 90% every 2 to 2.5 hours. Around town I probably get around 500km to a full charge, though only charge to 85% to preserve the life of the battery. \\n\\nWhen we’ve gone away for a weekend, just plugging in to a power point is enough to give you at least 200km range overnight. (3pm-9am)\\n\\nI drive from Ferny Hills to St Lucia for work, 35 mins, and it takes about 4% of the battery.\\n\\nI get that it’s expensive and not accessible for a lot of people, but for those for whom it may be viable, just take one for test drive. Make up your own mind.\\n\\nOh, and it absolutely spanks the AMG S63.', \"I am fighting for my vehicle Jaguar E-pace 2020 to be fixed \\n\\n \\n\\nIn July my vehicle had an engine light come on and the car was running at no power. Jaguar roadside assist was called & they sent out an NRMA team guy to look over the vehicle. The NRMA guy had showed us the codes that came up on this car which were a persistent\\n misfire & running on 3 cylinders. There was nothing NRMA could do on their end to fix the vehicle so it had to be sent to the closest dealership. The vehicle was then towed to the closest dealership\\n\\n \\n\\nThe vehicle was scheduled to be assessed on the 6th of August 2024. Dealership has stated that there is a misfire & that the car was a 15K job. Dealership also stated that this issue has a bulletin that addresses how\\n to fix the issue. We also asked what was the needs for this job as to why is it 15K? Dealership said this was for a lot of parts that they needed to order like injectors etc.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThis was being put through Extended warranty through Alliance. Dealership needed some extra information from myself about the service history which I happily provided. I sent in via email X2 service history invoices to be passed on to Alliance as they were needing\\n these to proceed with the claim. The reason my car was not serviced at a Jaguar dealership was due to living in a non-Jaguar/land rover dealership town. I had also asked the Dealership  if he could send through documentations as to what is needing to be done to this\\n vehicle, I never received this.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe claim on this vehicle was approved on the 22nd of August. Dealership stated that my car would be completed with a wait time of 2 weeks & there was a backorder of a product.  \\n\\nI didn’t hear back from Dealership for a little bit of time so I contacted them on the 11th of September via email following up on any updates on my vehicle. Dealership contacted back & said part is still on backorder with no ETA. They sent through description of this\\n part which is part number:. 10699L and a quote of $3500.80? Where this is not stated on the invoice, I will later bring up further along the line. This part was ordered on the 12th of August, a month already gone by.  \\n\\n \\n\\nI was also receiving updates via Jaguar customer service . The only updates I was receiving were the same thing every time, parts were on backorder & there was no ETA on this part.  \\n\\nOne day jag customer service contacted me & said that they had ordered this part from 3 different countries to see which one arrived the quickest which I thought was strange. There was one that had an ETA & it was coming from Europe arriving into Melbourne on the 21st of\\n October 2024. These phone calls are all be recorded through Jaguar.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWe are now in October Wednesday the 23rd 2024, i have contacted the Dealership to see if he has received this part as it was arriving on the 20th or 21st. The bloke I was dealing with stuttered abit & said it has arrived. I said great when will the process start & completion be completed?\\n He said that they were waiting for a hoist & car will not be completed by end of next week, this was via phone call. My father received a phone call 5 minutes after our chat & had been told that the vehicle should be done by the end of the day. I then received\\n via email not long after this call that he had been out the back and the vehicle was being worked on & will be completed by the end of the week.  \\n\\nTo me this all felt strange as to how it was going to be done end of next week to end of this week to now being completed the 24th of October 2024.  \\n\\nI emailed the dealership if we could pick the vehicle up on Saturday the 26th of October as we live 3 hours away & have the day off work. As their website states their opened Monday to Saturday.  \\n\\nSimon says that the service department is closed on Saturdays, so we chose to leave Friday around lunch to travel to Albury.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIt’s Friday the 25th of October & we arrived at the Dealership around 3.30pm to pick up the vehicle. When we got the car was not ready & it took them 10 minutes to find paperwork. Meanwhile I had called up this morning to let them know I was coming to pick the\\n car up.  \\n\\nPaperwork was given to us & they had showed us photos of oil being found throughout the engine & stated that this has all been cleaned. They also shown us a photo of the dash with an oil light on & I noticed that they reached a speed of 130kms with an oil\\n light on. I will attach a photo of this.  \\n\\nMy father also states that there were no injectors replaced when they said these were one of the things being replaced from the start. He states that they didn't need replacing?  I have now also noticed that the invoice is invoiced at $ 4744.50 not $15,000.\\n Dealership said he drove this car & it drives like a brand-new car.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWe proceeded outside to collect the vehicle. I’ve noticed before jumping inside the vehicle that the number plate was being held on by a cable tie & the fuel cap was sticking out & looked unusual. I checked the fuel cap & this had been broken & there was tape\\n holding it together.  \\n\\nWe then went back inside to show the bloke I was dealing with as my car never left my house this way & should not be leaving the dealership like this. He comes out & asks what’s wrong with it when you can clearly see it’s bent & does not sit in properly. He also asks us how does\\n it normally open, you push it and it bounces out. Shouldn't a jaguar worker know this? My mother says it should just pop open and he goes I know how it works, which I found rude. They knew nothing about this & tried to put it on me saying it could have\\n come like this, which we then said it never left our house like this. He took a photo of the issue & was going to look into it. He also states that they do not do work like this. \\n\\n \\n\\nI proceeded to leave the dealership & noticed the car felt unusual to drive so I swapped drivers with my father & let him drive. We drive off & an engine light comes on, car loses power & starts jerking. This almost resulted into an accident getting onto the\\n highway. This all happened within 5 minutes of leaving the dealership.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWe now are on our way back to the dealership as this was unacceptable. My father told the dealership that the issue was not fixed & the dealership said I drove that car yesterday 200kms and it drove like a brand-new car. My father said get in the car and see what we are talking\\n about. Worker jumped in pushed the throttle all the way down revved it & said I can hear the problem and took it straight to the garage to be looked at Monday.  \\n\\nWe are now 3 hours away leaving with no fixed car after 3 months.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe 28th of October I received an email from the dealership that the cylinders are down on compression causing miss fire. He said the state of the engine is such that is now unserviceable and a new engine will be required.  \\n\\nDealership says I will be looking at a completed repair bill of $48,251.00. I contacted dealership  asking is this going through Alliance Warranty as this is way out of my control. Via phone call with dealership - says this will be coming out of my own pocket due to the wrong oil\\n being used. The wrong oil was never used.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThere was a phone call between my father & dealership. My father says something about the fuel cap & that it needs to be fixed, worker states that the car was broken into to syphon fuel out. Meanwhile they tried to blame me for this & I never received an apology.\\n We also said that this was a $15,000 job & said it was, but we said how when the invoice is invoiced at $4744.50. Dealership also told us that they are being audient (being looked into). That defiantly says something's dodgy with this dealership. Simon kept\\n refusing to put the claim through & we proceeded to contact someone higher in the Jaguar department.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWe also asked Simon about some of the parts on the invoice & he could not explain this to us.  \\n\\nSimon had called up our mechanic and asked what oil he had used; he had told him the wrong oil due to being put on the spot and not knowing what car he was talking about. Simon proceeded to write down on the invoice of the mechanics the wrong oil & sent it\\n in for a claim. We contacted our mechanic & the right oil was used 0W20 & he spoke to Simon clearing this up on the right oil he used.  \\n\\nNow Simon is saying it is still not acceptable because it is not a long-life oil.  \\n\\nThe claim was not accepted.  \\n\\n \\n\\nI’ve also spoken to someone in the warranty company & i have described to them about the oil not being correct and resulted into needing a new engine. They said that our stories are different as to why it didn't get accepted. Simon is not telling me the full\\n story or something's gone wrong with my car. \\n\\nHe couldn't tell me much as this is due to being a manufacturer warranty.  \\n\\n \\n\\nI am a 24-year-old lady, 2 weeks away from giving birth as a single mother. I am being left without a car & am still currently paying off this car. I would like for Jaguar to fix the issue as i am being treated unfairly & my car has been treated with disrespect.\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nHow do I not know the car has resulted to this due to: \\n\\nThe car being broken into to syphon fuel out? \\n\\nWas it stolen?  \\n\\nHow did my car do 130 on the speedo with an oil light & running on 3 cylinders?  \\n\\nAlso why was the car not picked up from the start that it was running on low compression & needing a new engine?  \\n\\n \\n\\nWhy did Simon say this is a $15,000 job but its $4744.50?  \\n\\nWhy was this a 2-week job turned into 3 months? \\n\\nHow did the car drive smooth for them when immediately i had an engine light straight away? \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter all of the debacle my vehicle was sent back to Griffith via a tow truck. We then made a phone call to a different dealership as this is where the vehicle was originally purchased from. We spoke to Trent & explained the situation. Trent had told us due to the sludge\\n throughout the engine this could have been created due to spark plugs, solenoids a cvv which was changed. My vehicle was towed to the next dealership  & Trent had got back to us with the vehicle needing 2 solenoids changed. Trent had put this through Alliance warranty\\n as my vehicle has extended warranty. Alliance declined this claim & Trent tried his best to get them to approve it. Jaguar accepted this as a goodwill & Trent told us that if anything else is wrong within the extended warranty period that they will fix the\\n issue. I have this in email also from Trent.  \\n\\nOnce the claim was approved this only took a couple days and the vehicle was ready to be picked up. We drove to Sydney with my newborn baby who was only 4 weeks. Upon arrival Trent explained to us what was done & that the oil in the vehicle looked fine. 1st dealership\\n had changed the oil previous fix, but vehicle was not fixed.  \\n\\nThe vehicle was ready to be driven off. Once on the highway heading towards Newcastle way the vehicle started to slow down & stalling. Lucky my brother was on the highway & pulled up behind me as it was just myself & my baby.  \\n\\nThe vehicle was then towed away again. Jaguar refused to take this back to the 2nd dealership as this is where i wanted it to go. They said the 2nd dealership was more than 100ks from where i was when it was only around 50ks. The vehicle was taken to a 3rd dealership which is 4ks from\\n The 2nd dealership .  \\n\\nJaguar told me the vehicle was being taken to Northern beaches JLR. When i called northern beach, my vehicle was not there. Lucky the tow truck had told me where they took it. How did Jaguar not know where my vehicle went?  \\n\\n3rd dealership told me that my vehicle needs a service & that this could fix the issue. The vehicle did not need a service until another 200kms. Not sure how a service will fix a cylinder misfire. Then he had come back to tell me they were following a bullentin. This\\n is what the 1st dealership had done. I explained that this was already done & it does not need to be done again. He said they were going to send off the oil & get it tested. 1st dealership were the last to change the oil. They were horrible at getting back to me with updates.\\n I had to ring & they told me it needed a new engine. I asked if they sent off the oil, they said they didn't need to then they told my father they looked at the oil with their eyes & there was sludge throughout the oil. They could not give me an answer to\\n why it needs a new engine. They said the services played a part in it. The vehicle had up to date services.  \\n\\n3rd dealership tried to put this claim through, this was knocked back by JLR. Trent from 2nd dealership in an email had advised 3rd dealership  that if alliance will not accept the claim that JLR will do as goodwill. Trent also advised JLR head office. This was all knocked back.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHow were the last two claims accepted but this will not be accepted? \\n\\nAlliance has advised us this vehicle has 5 year warranty with JLR.  \\n\\nMy hire vehicle was stopped being paid for from JLR & was reported stolen. No one had told me this vehicle needed to go back till after this was reported stolen.  \\n\\nWhy are they saying due to lack of servicing when they accepted last two claims with the correct servicing & never once questioned the servicing?  \\n\\n \\n\\nThis is unfair to me as i am a single mum, this vehicle is still being paid off. The servicing on this vehicle is up to date. I cannot afford $38,000 - $45000 for a new engine. This is a whole brand-new car.  \\n\\n\\nWHATS THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS? \\n\", '\\nI’ve never owned a car before, so I don’t have the experience to spot a good deal or recognize if a car might turn out to be a lemon. \\n\\nWhat tips would help me choose a reliable used car and avoid getting ripped off? \\n\\nAlso, which car brands are known to be reliable, affordable, and easy to maintain—and which ones tend to be expensive to maintain and should probably be avoided?', 'I recently bought a used lemon. Did all the \"right\" things, or so I thought: got car checked by a mechanic; dealer was recommended by a trusted friend; reliable make and model; price was fair. Turns out this car is rusting from the inside out. I bought it for $20k and I might be able to get $5k on it on a trade-in (it won\\'t get a RWC - I don\\'t have the sort of dodgy mechanic connections dealers seem to have).\\n\\nI\\'m now extremely reluctant to buy another used car at that sort of price, because it feels like pure luck of the draw to get a reliable one. \\n\\nI could drop $20k on a 10 year old used car and hopefully get something that will last me a good 5,6 years; or I end up with another s\\\\*\\\\*tbox that I lose $15k on.\\n\\nOR I buy something cheap (around $5-$10k). At least then if it craps out I haven\\'t lost a whole lot.\\n\\nOR I take out a loan or lease to get a new car (budget $30k to $40k).

Sorry if similar posts have been going around and for the slight rant here but what on earth is going on with purchasing used or even new cars in Australia??? Prices are crazy and dealers wont even negotiate. \\n\\nI am in Brisbane and I've been going around different car dealerships and I've seen things like 2022 Mitsubishi ASX with 80,000km on it for $26k when if you literally go to the Mitsubishi website you can find a BRAND NEW ONE for $28,500??? How does that make any sense?? Something similar applies to Mazda CX-30 or CX-5... only a few grand away from a bran new one, and they sell it for insanely high prices...

Could stretch it to $25k for the IDEAL car but hoping not to spend that much and I am completely shocked with prices... At first I was eyeing MGs but seeing all the comments on here I might pass on those. I am now looking at brands like Toyota, Nissan, Mazda or similar, no older than 2017-18 and ideally under with 100,000km... Is this happening to everyone? What's going on with the car market these days?\\n\\nAlso, can anyone explain why brands like MG, Jeep or European brands get so much hate?

Just landed in Adelaide 3 days ago. From the UK. I definitely need a car here as public transport isn’t very reliable. Having to take Uber quite frequently which is not good for my wallet and I don’t get paid for another month because payroll takes time so have set a budget of $7.5K for a car not including third party property insurance and government charges and rego\\n\\nI saw a 2010 Holden Cruze on Carsales with 200K on it. Looked ok. A car of this age and mileage I wouldn’t expect to be in mint condition and would defo expect some wear and tear. Was 5K AUD for the car so I thought it was very cheap. In person inspection showed big strips of chipped paint here and there which wasn’t obvious in the picture but if they were that obvious in person I thought they should mention those at least. But hey at least it can get me from A to B without breaking down every so often or so I thought. Drove it around the yard and there were knocking noises from the hood. Another red flag because this was not declared in the description online but drove ok otherwise without staling. Was still happy and serious as the price was cheap for me and I was happy with the car if it had a life of another 2 years which is when I will plan to upgrade and just for peace of mind I arranged a PPI and (I don’t know much about cars other than driving and making the usual oil and tyre checks) I was shocked that this thing had an oil leak under the hood. So defo not even worth 5K in my book and not suitable for me given I am new to Australia and the last thing I would want is to be dealing with a car that breaks down constantly and doesn’t get me from A to B whilst I am already stressed about the move and adjusting to a new country. I did feel that it was fishy that the dealer didn’t want me to get the keys to open the hood and he just went inside leaving me outside so I didn’t get a proper look at the car but even then I am not a car person and given the dealer wasn’t very forthcoming about the cosmetic damage (I don’t mind cosmetic damage but the fact that the car’s condition didn’t match the description on car sales website was a big red flag for me). Dealer kept going on and on about how good condition the car is in and that he has already had the car inspected and the mechanic has given it the OK (I didn’t ask him for the official report or similar but even then I didn’t trust him and that maybe the mechanic will also get a commission if this car gets sold to me). He asked me to make a decision quickly because there two more people wanting to buy the car and he is only holding because I came first. I get a PPI which cost around $300 and they declared the car possibly unroadworthy even! \\n\\nWhat else can I do to avoid buying a car I might regret? The $300s are gonna add up and I am looking at another car now so need to be very selective which cars I want a mechanic to inspect. I can inspect myself for obvious faults and the behavior of the dealer for red flags so that I spend the 300$s more wisely and also that if it is too cheap, there is something more to it ', 'Hello, me and my family are emigrating to Australia from the UK this year and I am looking for the perfect modern classic to use as a daily. \\nThis category of cars is that they are new enough to be comfortable and reliable.

We drove the car and really liked it, we noticed the car had some scuffs in the interior but he said the car will be fully detailed before pickup. We were also told by him that we will be given a full orientation of the car and its functions once we come and pick it up.\\n\\nThen another person came in to assist us, I am assuming is the sales advisor, we negotiated on the car and it was initially listed around $34k and when we checked the car it\\'s at $32.5k. We were able to negotiate a deal at $31.4k (could probably do better but I\\'m bad a negotiating). Dealer said they were a large group and is a \"fixed price\" car dealer, meaning they included detailing, a full tank of gas, and 3 months rego as part of the sale. I am paying the full amount so I didn\\'t take any finance with the dealer.\\n\\nNow the bad part begins,   \\nonce we picked up the car, we noticed that the interior of the car had more scuffs and marks that were not there previously, there was a smidge of white mark (possibly paint) in the leather seat and a drop of white paint on the side of the driver seat. I do think this is due to the detailing process. We complained to the sales advisor and all we got was he tried to vacuum it and will give us a cleaning product recommendation.\\n\\nAt this point, my partner and I were already disappointed and didn\\'t know what to do as this was our first car and making this decision has been difficult for us. \\n\\nComes the part where we take the picture beside the car, the sales advisor took the pictures from his phone and it took 3 days just to get a picture sent to my email and multiple text reminders. Once I have signed all the legal documents, he hurried us out of the building and into the car, there was no promise of car introductions and all, it was all a lie.\\n\\nThe tipping point for me to write up this post:  \\nHad an email notification saying that the car is successfully transferred under my name but I need to renew my rego as it is expiring in 3 weeks. I was puzzled and furious to learn that the rego has not been renewed by them. I gave the sales advisor a call and he said due to an issue in the system, they were unable to do it for us due to it being near the end of FY, so instead they need me to do it myself and they will reimburse it.\\n\\nNext thing I did was I wrote him an email to confirm that they will reimburse before I make such payments. I have yet to hear back from him as it has only been a few hours but we both were severely disappointed by the service and the false promises that were made.\\n\\nRegarding the car itself, did a mini road trip for the weekend and thankfully no issues whatsoever. We were both happy with the car but very disappointed with the non-existent service that was promised.\\n\\nMoving forward, I probably just need to follow up and see where this leads, but if they still don\\'t reply, what options do I have?\\n\\nSome background: I have been in Australia for almost 10 years and only got a reason recently to buy a car as my partner and I will be going to a new phase in our lives.

Any hidden gems or classic go-tos I should consider? Thanks in advance! ', 'I don’t understand used car prices in Aus.  A new i30 is $30K, a 9-10 year old one is 15K.  You’d assume the car will last 15 years before having serious problems…so the best years are the first 5.  Why do people pay half the new price for a car 2/3 of the way through it’s useful life?  This one is 2011 and they want 14K, are people actually buying these or are they offering 7-8K for them?

My budget is around $40-$55k. I've considered BMW, Audi, Merc but don't want the hassle of reliability issues after a few months of owning the car, especially since majority of euro cars I can afford in this price range will be out of warranty/end of warranty. \\n\\nMy two choices at the moment are an i30N and Stinger GT. The i30N will probably be a more 'fun' car to drive, but I'm mostly going to be using it to go A to B, not so much on the track. Interior and power is much better on the Stinger GT. Having sit in some euro cars (which the Stinger is a lot closer to), the i30N cabin just feels miles apart.  \\n\\nIs it worth spending another $10-15k on a Stinger? Or should I save the $10-15k on some upgrades for the i30N or use on something more financially responsible. Although, I imagine the Stinger GT might hold its value a bit better than the i30N though when it comes time to selling the car.\\n\\nThanks in advance!\", 'Occasionally I see people comment about a CX5 or 6 Diesel and I say \"Refer to my post history\". Wanted to do a complete timeline of this misadventure so that it might help someone avoid my mistakes. This has a lot of detail, so feel free to skip the end. But if you are considering a Mazda Diesel of the 2014-2018 variety (or heck, a Mazda Diesel at all) recommend you read it all. \\n\\n2022 - Wife is \"With Child\". I spent months convincing her that an Impreza probably isn\\'t going to cut it. I do a post on CarsAustralia. Several people mention the Mazda 6 Wagon as a good option. None mention the diesel issues. A VERY quick google doesn’t reveal any problems (though a later detailed search after purchase would). Wife finds a Mazda 6 wagon 2015 she likes, refuses to entertain the idea of a SUV and wants a wagon like its still the 90s. \\n\\nJan 2023 - We test drive the car, it drives well. We check to see if the pram fits in the boot. it does easily. The seller knows we are soon to have a kid. Initially have trouble with finance (plan is to buy the 6 under finance then sell the Impreza to pay off the loan). We argue with the bank that the car isn’t THAT old and is a Mazda, it is reliable (Ironic). They agree and finance the car. $19k later we own a Mazda 6 wagon.\\n\\nLate Jan - We pick up the car that weekend. Probably do 300-400km in it. First sign of trouble is the car stalls whilst driving after its been idling a while. Restart, and it stalls again. Restart, and its totally fine. Take it to the mechanic. He spends a week on it, no codes. No errors. No sign of fault. Can’t replicate. \\n\\nFeb – Car is fine\\n\\nMarch – Car dash lights up light a Christmas tree on the way home from having the baby seat installed (again, ironic), dash says pull over and don’t drive. Tow track to the mechanic. Mechanic is surprised to see the car given it was serviced the previous week. Turns out something (suspect a rat) has chewed the drive belt which cut the alternator. Easy fix. But sets the tone for what’s to come: more bad luck.\\n\\nLate March – The car is running rough. Really rough. I say to the wife “I think this thing is going to stall” as I stop at a corner, indicating to turn. I was right. It dies. I restart, and dead. Restart: Dead. Restart: dead. We sit there for a minute, blocking traffic when finally on the 8th or 9th attempt, the car restarts. I limp it home and immediately rip out the baby seat and install it in the Impreza, thanking whatever gods exist that I haven’t yet sold it. The 6 drive perfectly fine to the mechanic who spends the next month working on it.  I contact previous owner who claims to have no knowledge. I contact the mazda dealer it was purchased from, no history of a similar fault. \\n\\nApril – Mechanic cant fault it. Cant replicate the fault after putting 100s of Ks on it (with our permission). Eventually, the car wont start one morning, flat battery. Mechanic replaces the battery and says “Hopefully a faulty battery? Let us know how you go”. I refuse to let my son in the car. I suggest we sell the 6 whilst its running. Wife refuses, it is her car I can’t force her.\\n\\nJune – No sign of problems. We consider selling the Impreza. Wife was driving the 6 comes home and reluctantly admits the car emitted a weird thump and was struggling to change gear, numerous warning lights. Back the mechanic. Code about turbo pressure. Clear code, cant replicate fault. Again recommend we sell the car. Again, shot down. Mechanic recommends taking it direct to Mazda. Car goes to local Mazda dealer who describe it as of a “problematic era”. They spend a month and can’t replicate the fault. They replace a carbon sensor under an extended warranty. Mazda claim the car is fixed.\\n\\nJuly/August: Occasionally idling or starting a little rough, but no faults. Baby seat goes back in the Mazda, I was right: The Impreza was too small. \\n\\nSeptember: Car struggles to get up to speed when pulling onto freeway. Acts as if the accelerator is being mashed wildly, complete lack of power. Car dies 10km latter at 100km an hour on the freeway with kid in the back seat. But restarts no problems. Taken straight to Mazda. Tell the wife she can either sell the Mazda or she can take over dealing with it, but I nor kid won’t get in that car ever again. Wife agrees (reluctantly) to sell. \\n\\nMazda spend the next couple of weeks trying to replicate, eventually they do. Detected as a fuel pressure problem. They request ok to spend 2.5k to remove fuel system and test. We see no choice, only other option is to sell to a wrecker for bugger all. Fuel system test completed, no faults. Car still stalling. Mazda start slowly replacing fuel system parts one by one and testing to see if the car still faults. Suggest again to Mazda to hook up a multimeter to the fuel pump. Surprise! It’s a solenoid in the fuel pump starving the car of diesel. Mazda spend the next couple of weeks ordering replacements. They do this work for free, but still charge us the $2.5k for the fuel tests, that didn’t detect a fault even though it WAS in the fuel system.\\n\\nSell the Impreza to clear the debt, sell the Mazda for $11k to a business (couldn’t in good faith sell it privately in case another family got screwed). Told the wife we’re getting a new SUV with a warranty to stop this happening again, sold my baby (not the actual one, the Impreza) to fix this mess so its my call, she agrees cause she is over it too. Go out and order a Kia Sportage which is what we probably should have done in the first place.\\n\\nTLDR: People love Mazda, but when push comes to shove I\\'d argue they don’t know their cars as well as you’d hope. It took them 2 goes and several months to fix it. And even then I sold it before I found out if it was truly fixed at a decent loss. The 6 was a great car, I understand why the wife struggle to want to sell it. But for the love of everything: **Do NOT buy the 6 Diesel.**', \"I am new ro Australia and want to get a car to use for a year or so. My budget is 15k and looking for a used car.

And the sulphur content in many 91 fuels is criminal. And some 91 fuels aren\\'t really 91. It doesn\\'t take long for the higher fractions to evaporate, and then you\\'re looking at 90 or 89 or worse. Not really a problem with a popular/busy petrol station, but some little cafe-with-a-pump out in the regions could be suspect.\\n\\nHOWEVER\\n\\nThe fuel/ignition map in the ECU designated as \"tested at 91\" is only a starting point. There is some learning going on, influenced by many factors, including driving habits (lots of start-stop, or lots of highway), higher or lower ambient air temperature, AND the fuel\\'s resistance to knocking (which in any grade of fuel, can vary somewhat), and many others. There\\'s a lot of tests performed by the ECU before it puts the system into \"closed loop\" mode, which is where it\\'s supposed to be for maximum efficiency and minimum emissions.\\\\*\\n\\nUp to a point, advancing the ignition timing gives you better efficiency - more power from a given volume of fuel, and benefits in emissions. That point is where detonation occurs. So, with a knock sensor, the ECU can advance ignition timing continuously until the knock sensor goes off, and then it backs off the ignition timing a little. It happens many times per second, and the ECU makes other decisions about fuel and ignition timing based on the input from other sensors - Mass Air Flow, throttle position, air temp, coolant temp, the readings from the pre-cat O2 sensor/s compared to the readings from the post-cat O2 sensor/s, etc, etc.\\n\\nSo a higher-octane fuel will allow your ECU to advance timing to improve power and efficiency - ***but only a little bit***. The improvement is not worth the extra price of the fuel/s. The argument against higher-octane fuels was perfectly valid before ECUs and knock sensors - you can\\'t change the compression ratio, so higher-octane fuels don\\'t help. But now, we can change the ignition timing very precisely, and that \\\\*does\\\\* make a difference.\\n\\nThere are additional additives in 98 fuels - like detergents/solvents to reduce carbon and varnish buildup - but you can do that yourself while still using 91 fuel - add a bottle of fuel injector cleaner twice per maintenance cycle - once when you change the oil, and once mid-way to the next service. Read the manual, it might recommend something different, but mine says to do it twice per cycle. A decent mechanic will also run some cleaning compounds through at oil changes. You need to look at some of the engine components to realise just how dirty it gets - EGR valve, PCV valve, the inlet tract after the throttle butterfly, and the inlet tract as a whole.\\n\\nSo, yes. Higher-octane fuels \\\\*will\\\\* improve performance A LITTLE BIT.

Higher octane fuels are better suited for engines with high compression ratios because they can withstand more compression before igniting. \\n\\nCompression Ratio:\\n\\nThe compression ratio is the amount the air-fuel mixture is compressed in an engine's cylinder before combustion. Low-compression engines have a lower compression ratio, so they don't need the high resistance to detonation that high-octane fuel provides. \\n\\nEngine Design:\\n\\nEngines are designed with specific compression ratios and fuel requirements in mind. Using the wrong type of fuel can lead to reduced performance or even damage. \\n\\nSlower Burning:\\n\\nIn a low-compression engine, high-octane fuel might burn slower or less completely, resulting in less power output and potentially reduced fuel economy. \\n\\nNo Benefit:\\n\\nHigh-octane fuel doesn't inherently provide a power boost in engines that don't need its high resistance to detonation. In fact, it might even hinder performance. \\n\\nRecommendation: Always use the fuel octane level recommended by your vehicle's manufacturer.

So we probably save $2-3k per year in fuel (my wife has a long commute).\\n\\n>association with Elon and other EV nuts.\\n\\nIt did play into my mind a bit, part of the reason I didn\\'t get a Tesla was I did not like the Elon assocation.\\n\\nAs for EV nuts, I don\\'t associate the general petrol/diesel driver with the pro-ICE / anti-EV nutjobs.\\n\\nSo too the general EV drivers should not be tainted by the existence of pro-EV / anti-ICE nutjobs.\\n\\nWe all know there are fringe elements in every community that can give it a bad name.\\n\\nAll this pro/anti EV crap will all die down eventually as market share continues to grow and people realise \"Oh they\\'re just a car - I don\\'t have to feel threatened by this change\".\\n\\n>more expensive to buy for like for like.\\n\\nI was literally going to buy a petrol X1 but the electric iX1 was cheaper.\\n\\nThe novated lease quote for the petrol was say $800 after tax vs say $500 after tax for the EV. So the sticker price is higher, but the after tax cost is lower, and after tax is what matters.\\n\\nFor less after tax money, the EV model also offered superior acceleration (0 to 100 in 5.x versus 0-100 in 7.x) and better inclusions.\\n\\nI saw you cover this in your \"pros\" so I probably should have skipped this comment.\\n\\n>high depreciation. Although this may be slightly over stated.\\n\\nAgree currently overstated but I think this will end up coming true when all the lease cars start hitting the market in full force.\\n\\nHowever currently, I\\'m looking to replace my second car (Golf) with another EV and going on carsales there really isn\\'t much I would consider \"cheap\". The way anti-EV nutjobs go on about how bad it is we should be seeing a Model Y for $20k.\\n\\nEV depreciation will also have a direct impact on ICE depreciation, because the second hand car markets are not isolated from each other. Plenty of people will consider both EV and ICE options once the prices come down. So when ICE cars can\\'t sell because people are buying $15k Model 3\\'s then the ICE prices will also have to drop a large amount to compete for second hand sales.\\n\\n>slightly more expensive insurance.\\n\\nYes, I would also add: \\n\\n* Tyres are a bit more expensive and wear out faster (lots of torque combined with heavier cars).\\n\\nI think my tyre cost over $600 when my wife picked up a nail on her commute.\\n\\n>long wait to get fixed if you get into an accident. We waited 4 months for a panel to get fixed. But we did get a replacement car during that time.\\n\\nI have no experience with this (touch wood) but I suspect the brand you choose will dictate this somewhat. A long established brand with supply chains already working properly might be supplying EV parts a bit faster.\\n\\n>most evs are not quite as fun as a lightweight sports car and obviously no sound. Manual sports are still more fun.\\n\\nI think no sound is a massive bonus. I used to ride my Kawasaki ZX6R with no noisy muffler upgrade because I wanted less attention from the cops. I leave everyone behind at the traffic lights and it doesn\\'t even sound like I\\'m trying. Police attention is minimised.

I personally have an ICE for many reasons (mainly that I constantly drive long distances up the coast and that I don’t have charging infrastructure at my apartment building, but also because I find driving my car far more engaging than my parent’s car despite it being slower). It’s fantastic for daily driving around town as long as you can charge at home, but sucks for long distances. Case in point last time my parents drove back down the coast I took them 12 hours (due to lines are charging stations) and took me 9. One of my main gripes though is how overdesigned many of them are - the perfect example is the polestar where to open the glove box you need to dive into the settings in the touch screen, or the position of indicators on the new Tesla model 3… like why! \\n\\nMy perspective more broadly is that the entire EV overhaul of the car industry (where people talk about how no one will be driving ICE in 10 years) won’t come. Although they don’t come with the daily emissions of an ICE, because of the far far greater production/material requirements and implications that come with that, you only break even with emissions with an ICE after a few years of daily driving. My thoughts are that EVs are just another form of energy to make a vehicle move, just as I’m sure hydrogen and others will come. \\n\\nThey certainly have their place and benefits in the market going forward which is fantastic for choice for consumers, but they are absolutely not the environmental periah that will save the world that people claim them to be (I’d argue that a buying second hand hybrid is astronomically better for the environment than buying a new EV).

A normal power plug is 10A.   If you are pushing 10A 240v back to the grid, that\\'ll power microwaves, tv\\'s etc.   It won\\'t put much of dent in something like a hot water system, oven or airconditioner.  \\n- Check your load into the car as well.   A 10A power plug will charge your car at about 2kw per hour.  So your battery is going to take 15 hours to charge from empty (if you get there), which exceeds your off peak period.   You may want to look at getting a 15A socket to bump that up a bit, or do what I\\'m doing and go single phase 32A.

If you get a full EV, some of them have \"as needs\" servicing, because there is no filters, water, oil, sparkplugs, and because of regen braking, you hardly touch the brakes.

I have driven both the Jolion, and an MG SUV for work vehicles, and was at the same time was using some other SUVs for work, so had a direct comparison with a Nissan Xtrail and a Suburu Forester.\\n\\n\\nFirst thing I noticed about the Jolion was the infuriating display interface. This seems to be a trend in cars, so it's not exclusive to Haval, but trying to navigate that menu to turn the aircon down while driving was seriously dangerous. Even with the auto lane assist/semi-self driving features. I would literally feel safer using my phone while driving a Haval than using the touch screen display.\\n\\nSecond thing I noticed was how cheap it was built. Everything is dirt cheap. Speakers are tinny, surfaces are easily damaged, interior just feels cheap and like you're going to break it. In fact, I literally had a client deform the interior panels on the door of an MG when his leg hit the door as he closed it.\\n\\nNow, this might seem a bit of a petty complaint, but [look at this.](https://i.postimg.cc/cJbgLRKt/20220224-135347.jpg). 'Please watch out your surrounding.' I dunno, but when I saw this it reinforced my view that there was very little quality control. It feels like this was simply run through Google translate, stuck in the car, and sent to market. Were there no native English speakers over at QA at Haval? Idk. It's not a performance issue, but this car definitely feels mass market and shipped as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThe Jolion made me feel really fucking dumb at times. There were two occasions where the car started beeping and screaming at me, and I had no idea what for. No indication of any issues. I had to pull over, restart the car, and then resume driving.  Second time was in a drive thru, car just started freaking the fuck out, like I was about to hit something with reverse parking sensor, but I was in drive and completely clear of obstacles. \\n\\nThe lane assist features pissed me off. I mean honestly lane assist kinda pisses me off in any car, but the Jolion made me feel genuinely unsafe. Several times I had tried to go wide of a rider and the car was absolutely determined to swerve back into them to maintain my position in the lane. The cruise control liked to do weird shit, like it wanted to auto speed control for but would decided to slam on the brakes in the middle of an 80 zone for weird reasons. For example, there is this one stretch of road here where the road spreads from normal to 4 lanes with an island between, and every time I approached there the car wanted to stop because it would detect the island ahead, but seemed not to care that the lanes curved away. I stopped using cruise control in this vehicle because I kept stopping in really unsafe ways at really unexpected times. Also, when I turned the lane assist off, it automatically turned back on each time I turned the car on, and turning it off requires digging through that fucking interface.\\n\\nNow, I've heard complaints of rust in these cars. I didn't see that, but what I did see is flecks of paint just separating from the bonnet. Within 6 months the bonnet looked a lot worse than it should for a new car, with little pock marks all across it. I'm told the vehicle had paint protection, but then later the owner was incredibly pissed about a)the paint failing, and b) how thin the paint layer was. He felt that the paint had not been applied correctly, and that the paint was applied too thin, but I don't really know if that's the problem or it's something else. Not really my area.\\n\\n\\nPerformance was okay, given the price. It wasn't the power, or lack thereof, that was problematic it was the dangerous interface to use the car's audio/aircon, and the strange behaviour from automated systems that really, really put me off this car. I have the option to buy one now, or wait a bit an get something in a higher price bracket, and I guarantee you I'm going to wait until I can get an xtrail/Mazda suv/suburu SUV.\\n\\nSpeaking of weird behaviour, the CVT did some strange shit too. Once i was pulling out of a Woolworths in the city, and it had a sloping driveway. The road it met with was sloping the other way. So imagine the car sitting atop a very wide 'V' shape, with wheels at the top of each slope. It was very, very hard to input just a small amount of throttle. The car wanted to do nothing, or lurch. I had this weird near miss where the car rolled backwards because most of the weight is in the front, and I nearly took out a pedestrian behind me. I tried to drive forward and the car lurched, nearly hitting a car passing me, then wanted to roll back and nearly hit the car that had pulled up behind me. It was quite stressful, and I could not provide a moderate input to gently roll. Consistent issue, and I found almost always it would lurch when starting off the line. Didn't help that the CVT seemed to have a bit of a lag period going from neutral to first either. \\n\\n\\nAll in all, not impressed with this car. Considered buying one, drove one for 6 months, absolutely will not touch these cars with a barge pole. MG had a lot of similar issues, but these were worse. Also, I reckon with the way the parking brake worked, you're probably doing damage to the CVT every time you try to park on a slope. It's a push button parking brake, which engages when the car is put into park, and it is not exactly responsive. Sometimes you might press 3 or 4 times over the course of 30 seconds to get it to engage. I was told by the owner that whenever i had it in park and the vehicle was allowed to roll at all, it was putting torque on the CVT and wearing it out. I'm not a mechanic, but I  can tell you that I had it roll while in park a great number of times, and not intentionally.\\n\\nMaybe this one was just a lemon, but it certainly felt like it was fundamental design decisions that made the car shit, not necessarily the manufacturing quality. The lower quality of things like speakers is forgivable, it's a very budget SUV, very affordable. I get the feeling that 7 year warranty won't mean much when it spends a good chunk of those 7 years in the workshop and you spend a good chunk of them fighting with the manufacturer over small defects that shouldn't be occurring.\", 'Jolion, might as well just name it the Persephone', 'Jeff Yass, the billionaire Wall Street financier and Republican megadonor who is a major investor in the parent company of TikTok, was also the biggest institutional shareholder of the shell company that recently merged with former President Donald J.

Check when it last had the gearbox serviced/clutch kit done.\\n3. Check that it's had its air con recently regassed - and importantly, checked for leaks. A regas is a tiny amount of money, a whole compressor is not. We're going to have a long, hot summer. \\n4. Check if it's had a new starter motor or alternator done, and if the car's not been driven a lot recently, how the battery is.\\n5. Make sure you get the damn radio code!!! Make the owner/seller get it for you before they sell as it can cost to access this if no one knows it. \\n6. Check when the brake discs (not just brake pads) were last replaced - it can pass RWC with them almost in need of replacement\\n7. Not disc brakes? Check the drum/cylinder replacement records.\\n8. Not such a worry on Toyota/Hyundai, but ask if any of the ignition coils have been changed (frequent issue in cars where someone's been using the wrong fuel.)\\n9. If it has an ignition that requires a chipped key to open it, make sure you have two working keys supplied with the car before you buy. Test them yourself. If you've only one, the key battery running out and leaving you stranded is is horrible, but worse is if the system fails and you have to have it reprogrammed/introduced to a new key (can be horribly expensive.) This goes for your eyes at home! Swap the one in the drawer onto your keyring occasionally. Replace your lost/destroyed key ASAP (yes it's expensive. Not doing it can be more expensive!) \\n10. Check to see if the radiator has been replaced, and if not recently pressure tested. There is so much plastic in cooling systems in modern cars that they can get very, very brittle and fail quickly. \\n11. Check the age of the tyres, and if they match brand front to back.

Top hose issue; a known fault on that donk. \\n\\nA couple of days later? Same thing.

Called \\'em and complained. \\n\\nThe service droid asked \"Did the warning come up? If there\\'s no warning then you\\'re wrong!\", so we had a short but terse conversation because it didn\\'t and the visual inspection of the coolant tank was outside the BMW spec, so I referred it to the sales manager. I got a call to take it back and they would have another car for me. \\n\\nI think the service manager treated me badly because I dress like crap and look like I don\\'t have $0.02 to my name, but my wife dresses resplendently even to go to Westfield. The Sales Manager probably took note of that and gave the Service Manager a wee rectal rocket. I don\\'t bother dressing unless I\\'m facing a client; been there, done that, did the corporate grind; who am I trying to impress? Not a car dealership\\'s staff. \\n\\nTook it back and this time they found and fixed the problem: cracked water pump, which appeared AFTER they replaced the top hose which should have been fixed in a known BMW recall. The increased cooling system pressure opened the crack. \\n\\nAll done under warranty without a flinch, and they even gave us a nice toy to drive while the work was being done.

Of note, work related exemptions are generally restricted to when you are on duty and at your place of work.\\n* *Application Process:* Typically involves filling out a form, providing supporting documents, and possibly attending an office or service center.\\n[NSW](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/transaction/apply-high-performance-vehicle-exemption-provisional-p1-and-p2-drivers)\\n[SA](https://www.mylicence.sa.gov.au/gls/p-platers/p1-licence)\\n[QLD](https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/licensing/getting/pplates)\\n[VIC](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/licences/your-ps/get-your-ps)\\n\\nFor the most accurate and detailed information, it\\'s best to refer to the official transport authority websites of each state or territory.\\n\\n# Insurance\\n\\nThere are 3 main types of Insurance in Australia, they are:\\n\\n1. Compulsory Third Party\\n2. Third Party Property\\n3. Comprehensive Insurance\\n\\n**Compulsory Third Party**\\n\\nCTP insurance, also known as \"Green Slip\" in NSW and \"TAC\" in Victoria, is mandatory in all states and territories. It covers costs associated with injuries or deaths caused to other people in an accident involving your vehicle.\\n\\nIt does not cover damage to your own vehicle, other people\\'s vehicles, or property.\\n\\nCTP is legally required to register your vehicle, ensuring that any injuries caused to third parties in an accident are covered.\\n\\n**Third Party Property**\\n\\nThis insurance covers damage you cause to other people\\'s property (e.g., their car or home) in an accident\\n\\nIt does not cover any damage to your own vehicle or injuries to yourself or your passengers.\\n\\nMany providers offer an additional \"Fire and Theft\" option, which covers your vehicle if it is stolen or damaged by fire.\\n\\nIt provides a more affordable way to protect yourself against potentially high costs of repairing someone else’s property.\\n\\n**Comprehensive Insurance**\\n\\nComprehensive insurance provides the highest level of coverage. It covers damage to your own vehicle and property, as well as damage you cause to other people\\'s property. It also includes coverage for theft, vandalism, and natural disasters.\\n\\nSome policies may have exclusions, so it\\'s important to read the policy details carefully.\\n\\nAlthough it is the most expensive option, comprehensive insurance offers extensive protection and peace of mind by covering a wide range of incidents.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can visit resources like [Finder](https://www.finder.com.au/car-insurance-types) and [Canstar](https://www.canstar.com.au/car-insurance/ctp-third-party-property-comprehensive/).\\n\\nTo help find insurance, you can use the free tools provided by the [Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/) at [Find an Insurer](https://www.findaninsurer.com.au/)\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The Atto 3 - excuse the awkward phrasing - one of the oldest \"newer EVs\". I feel like the included tech and EV bits outclass the \"newer model older EVs\" like Kona EV, original Hynadai Ioniq and the MG ZS.\\n\\nShould be able to find them around $35K. Probably heaps coming off leases around about now.\\xa0\\n\\nBecause you don\\'t get a GST discount _and also_ prices have been dropping you might want to check whether, say, a GST discount on a new $40K Geely EX5 is more appealing than a $35K 2nd hand Atto 3. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking at 2nd hand Atto 3 just be aware the 2022 and 2023 models don\\'t work with Tesla v3 and v4 super chargers. A fix will is supposedly under testing now and will be available later this year. 2024 models are fine.\\n\\nAlso check the tyres if looking at a 2022/23 model. The original \"batman\" tyres are terrible. If the car is still on originals factor in a replacement sooner rather than later.', 'The ev has to be first registered or used on or after 1st July 2022.
