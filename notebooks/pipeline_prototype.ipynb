If you are doing long distance, it\\'s borderline useless in Australia. So many of the chargers don\\'t work properly if it\\'s not a tesla super charger. And there aren\\'t enough superchargers around. I have to plan a lot for a road trip, but generally it\\'s more annoying than prohibitive. \\\\n- If you don\\'t have home charging, it can be a real problem. But this problem is getting better. \\\\n- association with Elon and other EV nuts. Most people who drive cars just want a comfortable car, but some of the EVangelists are a bit much. \\\\n- more expensive to buy for like for like. Ev version of the same brand car is more expensive \\\\n- high depreciation. Although this may be slightly over stated. \\\\n- slightly more expensive insurance. \\\\n- long wait to get fixed if you get into an accident. We waited 4 months for a panel to get fixed.  But we did get a replacement car during that time. \\\\n- most evs are not quite as fun as a lightweight sports car and obviously no sound. Manual sports are still more fun. \\\\n\\\\nPros\\\\n- charging experience at home is amazing. I don\\'t have a home charger and I just plug it into a normal plug. Get about 200km over night. Not needing to go fuel up is so good.  There is the obvious cost savings of charging at night.\\\\n- driving experience for commuting is amazing. Quiet, quick, effortless and basics self driving is awesome. \\\\n- instant torque is addictive. It\\'s very difficult to go back to ice cars after getting used to instant torque. \\\\n- cheaper than equivalent ice, depending on what you value.  I\\'d argue for the same power, torque and comfort, you\\'d have to pay for for an ice car than an EV.  Not many 3 second 0 to 100 ice cars that\\'s under $100k. Not many ice cars offer the same comfort and quietness for the same price. So Evs are simultaneously more expensive and cheaper.  The ora is now under 30k, which is cheaper than most ice cars of the same size. \\\\n- time saving, money saving and stress saving from the lack of service required. Had 1 service in 4 years and 1 wheel realignment.  Otherwise no issues. My last car was an Audi and that was a disaster even after 1 year. Previous car before that was a corolla and that also had issues over 5 years. Not a single issue with the model 3 so far. \\\\n- more interior space. EVs have way interior space and interior storage for the same size car. \\\\n- less break use. I love regen breaking now. It means that how much I press down the accelerator equals what speed I want. It\\'s much more intuitive. \\\\n- salary packaging. Depending on your tax bracket, this would make EVs significantly cheaper. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPersonally if you are mostly using the car for commuting and city driving. EVs are vastly superior.

Firstly I was put off by the curt \\\\\"okay\\\\\" I received when correcting the person on the phone regarding the engine the car had. I don\\'t know much about insurance, but I imagine there might be issues if the car was noted down as having the wrong engine! \\\\n\\\\nSecondly, I was further disappointed when I was told that my \\\\\"modern car\\\\\" could not be insured for an agreed upon value greater than what I paid for it, even though I got it at a good deal, as the system did not recognize that only 100 of them were ever sold in Australia! What kind of \\\\\"enthusiast\\\\\" insurance company does not take into account the limited production of a vehicle and only considers the age?   \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- Poor policies:  \\\\nIn regards to their policy conditions, Shannons is behind even Budget Direct.   \\\\nShannons does not care that the car will be driven maybe 1000km a year, they only note down whether it\\'s driven daily, weekly, fortnightly, etc. Budget recognizes kilometers driven and lowers the price of the policy accordingly. In fact, most of the insurance company\\'s asked me what KM the car would be used for, rather than when it would be. Another strike against Shannons. \\\\n\\\\nFurther comparisons revealed that Shannons was more expensive than the average company, that wanted to insure it (disregarding the 6k-7,5k policies I got from QBE and Allianz) and provided less benefits than them. No over 25 excess, free towing, windscreens, etc can all be gotten from other company\\'s on a cheaper policy.   \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- Poor value:  \\\\nA bit of rehash of the above two points, but an important one.   \\\\nIf you\\'re going to charge more than the competition and provide less benefits, you better provide better value at least...   \\\\nEnthusiast Insurance, NRMA and Budget Direct all gave me policies that were CHEAPER and provided me with a GREATER value than Shannons. So why would I even continue with Shannons? \\\\n\\\\nIn the end I\\'m moving my current car to Enthusiast Insurance and putting my new car on NRMA. Enthusiast won\\'t cover high powered cars for people under 30, but NRMA has great benefits so we\\'ll see what happens when I go to compare in the future.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the buyout of Shannons seems to have ripped the heart out of the company. They seem to rely on people not shopping around and making money off older people who keep their car garaged and are unlikely to claim. That\\'s fine, Enthusiast Insurance and everyone else does it too, but the cost of the insurance vs the value provided has certainly tipped the scales. \\\\n\\\\nIf you have a modified car, I join a lot of car people on reddit and recommend Enthusiast Insurance.   \\\\nHopefully NRMA is okay. \", \"score\": 94, \"upvote_ratio\": 0.84, \"timestamp\": 1740555779.0, \"subreddit\": \"r/CarsAustralia\", \"num_comments\": 93}, \"10af7sb\": {\"title\": \"Haval owner 1yr expierence\", \"selftext\": \"Seing all the bashing that MG got the other day I\\'m interesting to see what all of you guys think about haval. By all of you, I mean people who actually know, have tried, or own an haval, not people that thought the same of kia and hyundai 10 years ago. Go to this post with open mind and not hate just because it is chinese.\\\\n\\\\nBefore I get to my 1 year expierence here\\'s why I bought it. I\\'m a big car guy since I was a kid and would\\'ve never touched a chinese brand in my life, but here I am, 1 year ago, researching haval.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the h2, which is a knock off of european cars, they re-created themself into building actual and proper cars. They hired ex german engineers to build the new cars, jolion, h6, tank. The 2022 cars engines are 3-5 years behind modern standards. The 2023 hybrid models are on par with the previous generation toyota engines. Interiors, absolutely no rivals in the price category, build quality, absolutely no rivals in the price category, features, absolutely no rivals in the price category, availability 2 months at max, rivals, more than a year (i wanted a rav 4), warranty, road assistance, capped services. So, after I test drove a sportage, tucson and the seltos, I test drove the jolion and h6. Right out of the gate, you don\\'t see the $10-20k price difference of the other brand. In my opinion, I thought the opposite, the havals should\\'ve been $10-20k more. While the h6 has a better snappier engine I chose the jolion as I didn\\'t need a huge car.\\\\n\\\\nOrder the car in November 21 and arrived in January 22. Paid $28k for the lux version. When it arrived the price was already up, $30k (it is now $31k). \\\\n\\\\nAfter one year and 13.000 kms the review is in and: by far the best purchase I have ever done.\\\\n\\\\nPro:\\\\n- The car drives well in any condition I used it for, urban, trips, holiday.\\\\n- All the features makes you feel you\\'re driving a modern car. Most of the time it drive itself, I just rest my hands on the sterring wheel. \\\\n- The engine is more than enough for the speed limits that are in Australia, it drinks a bit but it goes fine.  \\\\n- Lots of space\\\\n\\\\nCons:\\\\n- it needs setups. You need to go to every single menu and setup all the settings otherwise it is going to beep for anything. \\\\n- the only problem I had was a faulty battery at 300kms and racv came and replaced it in under 1hr, all included in the road assistance. (The guy said that a lot of them have this fault when they arrive from China.)\\\\n\\\\nNow, on the complaints that I read about haval in this subreddit:\\\\n\\\\n- Chinese: i feel you, but I don\\'t feel in a chinese car while driving\\\\n- build quality: for all of you saying it is shit, please go have a test ride\\\\n- interior build quality and features: same as before, let me know if you find anything even remotely closer below 50k.\\\\n- Parts: at my service, I requested to swap the blades and they had it. Not sure what happens with big parts if you crash, but also, if you don\\'t live in the bush, you can see how many they\\'re sellling on the road, it will be ridiculous to not have parts.\\\\n- Any second hand car is better: you guys are dreaming.\\\\n- depreciation: there are huge claims in this subreddit about massive depreciation up to 50%. In reality, these cars are new and people are buying it. So, after 1.5 years that they have been on the market, the retail price is going up and couldn\\'t find one below 25k on carsales.com.au.\\\\n- how it drives: it is a small suv, works as small suv, drives like a small suv. It is not a race car, or a sports car, and it is perfectly fine for under 110km/hrs. If we were in Europe with speed limits of 130 then I would reconsider.\\\\n\\\\nFeel free to ask any questions\\\\n\\\\nEDIT: for all the angry people I never said that it is the best car in the world. I\\'m only saying my expierience is different from what I read here and that after 1 year I think it is an amazing car for the price. In the future, it may rust, it may explode or whatever.

For something touted as the \\\\\"best truck in the world\\\\\" and the \\\\\"most popular truck in the world\\\\\", I\\'m not sure how people look past the reliability issues.\\\\n\\\\nHonestly, I wanted to make what the go was so I asked on r/Ford trucks, r/F150, r/Ford, and r/Trucks, instead I just got people blatantly saying that there hadn\\'t been these recalls and that their truck is the best truck.\\\\n\\\\nThis also excludes the Toyota Tundra because [although it\\'s officially in Australia, it\\'s not confirmed that it\\'s going to be sold in Australia](https://www.toyota.com.au/news/toyota-tundra-customer-evaluation-program-kicks-off) and it\\'s impossible to get a drive of.\\\\n\\\\nSo that leaves the two trucks that you can physically get your hands on, get in, and drive.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\'s the RAM 1500 Express and the Chevrolet Silverado LTZ, and I have to say.\\\\n\\\\nThe price difference between the base models is eye watering, $97,000 for the RAM and $147,000 for the Silverado is insane.\\\\n\\\\nBut.\\\\n\\\\nThe Silverado is definitely significantly nicer than the RAM, I would say it\\'s much closer to the RAM Laramie than it is to the Express, but the Laramie isn\\'t the base model, where the LTZ is.\\\\n\\\\nThe RAM, even in the Laramie trim is louder, has less features, and the fact that it can\\'t tow 4,500kg on a gooseneck is worrying in itself. RAM Australia has said that if you fit a Gooseneck, you immediately void all chassis and drivetrain warranties simply by having one fitted.\\\\n\\\\nWhich is interesting, because Goosenecks are more stable and offer significantly better weight distribution across axle groups over a traditional bumper pull setup. So it\\'s interesting that they say you can\\'t do it, and that it\\'s not rated.\\\\n\\\\nI have seen Ford Rangers and Hiluxes pulling Goosenecks before, if a fucking Ranger can do it, why can\\'t a RAM?\\\\n\\\\nThe features you get between the two are chalk and cheese, the Silverado has heated and cooled seats, adaptive cruise, lane keep, 360\\\\u00b0 Camera, and so on.\\\\n\\\\nThe RAM seems to be practically a whole generation behind in features, and the RAM dealer seemed to be more of a \\\\\"You get what you get\\\\\" type person rather than involve any conversation on the competition. Basically \\\\\"You buy this, or you buy that, I won\\'t discuss the differences or say why mine is better\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Basic\\\\\" (modern car) features that the Chevrolet has and the Ram are missing include Adaptive cruise control, Lane Keep Assistance, 360\\\\u00b0 Camera, Multiple Reversing Camera Angles, Remote Start, and rear USB charging ports.\\\\n\\\\nFrom a purely driving perspective, the Chevrolet sits in the lane better, it has much more direct feel on the steering, and not once did I run out of power driving it. Even towing, if I reached for that right pedal, it was there.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, GMSV let me have the car for 36 hours to live with, and that allowed me to do a trip to Hammerbarn, it let me go to the tip and take rubbish, it let me get in Highway time, it let me get city time, I got to park it and live with it.\\\\n\\\\nRAM was \\\\\"Let\\'s run around the block, 20 minute, in town, 5 minutes on the highway \\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI feel that Ran tried to hold onto \\\\\"We\\'re first in the market\\\\\" for too long, and then GM and Ford came in with a much better product.\\\\n\\\\nIf I\\'m going from a 79 Series to a 1500 Express, sure, the 1500 Express seems like a great car.\\\\n\\\\nBut anything with a little bit of tech, the 1500 Express is a step backwards.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m super disappointed for all the hype and everything on the F150, I just can\\'t see why it\\'s so popular when it\\'s practically unavailable to test drive due to recalls for months on end. Makes you wonder, you drop $140,000+ on one, how much time is it gonna be in the workshop or off the road due to faults?\\\\n\\\\nAesthetically, the F150 is by far my favourite, and from sitting in it, although not being allowed to drive, it is my favourite for the cabin layout.\\\\n\\\\nHonestly, after what GM did in the shutdown of Holden, I genuinely never thought I would look towards another GM product, but it seems that they have the best on the market.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, with the Silverado I got to actually experience loving with the car.\\\\n\\\\n1) Why the fuck do some people take up 4 car spaces to park the cunt? It\\'s not that big.\\\\n\\\\n2) Why do so many people in Hiluxes and rangers pull up next to you on the highway and rev the cunt out of their car and speed past you?\\\\n\\\\n3) Why do people say they are \\\\\"fuel guzzling\\\\\"? I averaged 12.5l/100 mixed Highway and Inner City, previously my utes have done around 12.3-12.8l/100km and that\\'s been a Hilux, a Ranger, and a T60. So it seems on par with economy to smaller utes.\\\\n\\\\n4) Why isn\\'t it possible to get this level of comfort in a Ranger or Hilux? This is simply proof that you can build a good comfortable ute that also doubles as a work vehicle and yet no other manufacturers seem to do it in the smaller utes.\\\\n\\\\n5) Why is this in the Jeep Gladiator the only utes on the market to have a sunroof?\\\\n\\\\n6) Why is a 12 pin trailer plug not standard?

Here\\'s a breakdown:\\\\n\\\\n ##What it covers:\\\\n\\\\nInjuries to others: CTP primarily covers bodily injury or death caused to other people in a car accident. This includes:\\\\n\\\\n1)Other drivers\\\\n2) Passengers in other vehicles\\\\n3) Pedestrians\\\\n4) Cyclists\\\\n5) Motorcyclists\\\\n\\\\n##What it doesn\\'t cover:\\\\n\\\\n1)Damage to vehicles or property: It does not cover damage to your own vehicle, the other driver\\'s vehicle, or any other property.\\\\n2) Your own injuries: It doesn\\'t cover your own medical expenses or lost income if you are injured in an accident.\\\\n\\\\n##How it works:\\\\n\\\\n1) Mandatory: You must have valid CTP insurance to register your vehicle in Australia.\\\\n\\\\n2) State variations: The specific rules and regulations regarding CTP insurance can vary slightly between Australian states and territories.\\\\n\\\\nIncluded in registration: In some states, the cost of CTP is included in your vehicle registration fees. In others, you need to purchase it separately from a licensed insurer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKey Points:\\\\nCTP insurance is essential for all vehicle owners in Australia.\\\\n\\\\nIt provides crucial financial protection for others who may be injured in an accident caused by you.\\\\n\\\\nIt is important to understand the specific rules and coverage limits that apply in your state.\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer: This information is for general knowledge and guidance only. It is not a substitute for professional legal or financial advice.\\\\n\\\\nI recommend contacting your state\\'s road transport authority or an insurance broker for the most up-to-date and accurate information on CTP insurance in Australia.\\\\n\\\\n#Self Insurance (Uninsured)\\\\n\\\\nSelf-insurance means that instead of paying premiums to an insurance company, an individual or entity assumes the financial responsibility for potential losses themselves.\\\\n\\\\n##How it works:\\\\n\\\\n1) You set aside a specific amount of money (often in a reserve fund) to cover potential losses.\\\\n\\\\n2) When a loss occurs (like a car accident, medical expense, or property damage), you pay for it out-of-pocket from your reserves.\\\\n\\\\n##Pros:\\\\n\\\\n1) Potential cost savings: If losses are lower than expected, you can save money compared to insurance premiums.\\\\n2) Greater control: You have more control over claim decisions and how your funds are used.\\\\n\\\\n##Cons:\\\\n\\\\n1) Significant financial risk: You bear the full financial burden of any losses, which could be substantial.\\\\n\\\\n2) Requires careful financial planning: You need to accurately assess potential risks and ensure you have sufficient reserves.\\\\n\\\\nIn essence, self-insurance is a risk management strategy where you take on the financial responsibility for potential losses rather than transferring that risk to an insurance company.\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer: This is a simplified explanation. Self-insurance can be complex and involves various legal and financial considerations.\\\\n\\\\n#Third Party Property & Legal Liability\\\\n\\\\nIn Australia, Third Party Property & Legal Liability insurance in the context of motor vehicles primarily covers the costs of damage you cause to someone else\\'s vehicle or property while driving.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFocus: Primarily covers financial losses incurred by others due to your driving.\\\\n\\\\n##Key Coverage:\\\\n\\\\n1) Damage to another person\\'s vehicle.\\\\n2) Damage to other people\\'s property (fences, buildings, etc.).\\\\n3) Legal Liability: Helps cover legal costs if you are sued by someone for property damage caused by your vehicle.\\\\n\\\\n***Important Note: This type of insurance does not cover damage to your own vehicle.***\\\\n\\\\nKey Differences from Compulsory Third Party (CTP) Insurance:\\\\n\\\\n1) CTP is mandatory in all Australian states and territories.\\\\n2) CTP focuses on covering bodily injury or death to another person caused by your vehicle.\\\\n\\\\nThird Party Property & Legal Liability insurance provides crucial financial protection for you if you accidentally cause damage to someone else\\'s property while driving. It\\'s a valuable addition to your overall car insurance coverage.\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer: This is a general overview and may not cover all specific situations or variations in policy terms.\\\\n\\\\nAlways refer to your policy documents or consult with an insurance professional for detailed information.\\\\n\\\\nSome third party liability coverage will provide a minor level of cover if you are hit by a self-insured/uninsured driver and may also provide some level of cover in the case your vehicle is damaged in a fire or it is stolen, This is not standard across all policies and may be an optional extra on top of the basic cover. \\\\n\\\\n#Comprehensive Insurance\\\\n\\\\nComprehensive motor vehicle insurance in Australia provides the broadest coverage for your vehicle. It typically covers:\\\\n\\\\n1) Damage to your vehicle: This includes accidents, fire, theft, natural disasters (storms, floods, hail), and vandalism.\\\\n2) Third-party property damage: Covers damage you cause to other vehicles or property.\\\\n3) Legal Liability coverage for the chats of legal fees\\\\n\\\\nOptional extras: These can include things like roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement, and personal accident cover.\\\\n\\\\nAgreed Value vs. Market Value:\\\\n\\\\n##Agreed Value:\\\\n\\\\nYou and the insurer agree on the value of your vehicle at the time of policy inception. If your vehicle is declared a total loss, you receive the agreed-upon amount, regardless of its market value at the time of the claim. This is beneficial for classic, vintage, or modified cars that may be worth more than their market value.\\\\n\\\\n##Market Value:\\\\n\\\\nThe insurance company pays you the market value of your vehicle at the time of the loss. This is determined by factors like age, condition, mileage, and current market prices.\\\\n\\\\nImportant Note: Comprehensive insurance usually does not cover wear and tear, mechanical breakdowns, or damage caused by driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer: This is a general overview. Always refer to your specific policy documents for detailed coverage information and exclusions\\\\n\\\\n#Key Notes:\\\\n\\\\nA lot of insurance policies will not cover you in the event that you are operating a vehicle illegally \\\\n\\\\nSo if your vehicle is not compliant with roadworthiness requirements in your state or territory, Or in the event your vehicle needs engineering And it does not have it, Then a claim can be denied. \\\\n\\\\nAlthough this does not come into play in every claim, this will certainly be a factor if the part of your vehicle that is unroadworthy or has been modified illegally is the cause of the accident or contributes to the accident being more severe. \\\\n\\\\nClaims can also be declined if you are speeding or driving in a manner that is dangerous or charged with some dangerous driving offences, however, this is less common.\\\\n\\\\nIn the event that you are operating the vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol, this can also void a policy. \\\\n\\\\nNot all insurance policies will cover you if you are off-road or on private property, however, some will cover you in the case that you are in an area you are legally allowed to be \\\\n\\\\nSome insurance policies will place driver restrictions on the policy, meaning that only listed drivers can drive it, And some policies will place a household restriction that everyone that lives in the same residence as yourself is required to be listed on the policy. \\\\n\\\\nEver since the banking royal commission in Australia, insurance companies are legally required to insure only the financial owner of the vehicle, meaning that if you are not the financial owner, it is insurance fraud to take out insurance on something that you do not own. \\\\n\\\\nThis is an incredibly common tactic where parents will insure a car that is owned by their children in order to avoid higher premiums and bring the cost of insurance policies down. \\\\n\\\\nInsurance fraud is a criminal offence in Australia, And if you are caught conducting insurance fraud, you can face jail time and incredibly large fines, And this may impact you in the future if you try and purchase another financial product such as insurance or obtain a bank loan. \\\\n\\\\nFor at least of insurance companies that may be able to offer you cover you can go to https://www.findaninsurer.com.au/ which is a service run by the insurance Council of Australia.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to make a complaint to the ombudsman for the insurance industry you can go to https://www.afca.org.au/ And logic complaint there with the ombudsman \\\\n\\\\nHowever, be aware that in order to have AFCA look at your case, you generally need to go through the complaints process for your insurance provider prior to raising this to the ombudsman \\\\n\\\\nThis subreddit takes a dim view on people recommending insurance fraud, any comments on this subreddit or any posts requesting for advice on how to commit insurance fraud will result in the post being removed \\\\n\\\\nFurther posts on the matter pertaining to advice on how to commit insurance fraud or request on how to commit insurance fraud will result in you being banned from this subreddit.\", \"score\": 40, \"upvote_ratio\": 0.83, \"timestamp\": 1737453832.0, \"subreddit\": \"r/CarsAustralia\", \"num_comments\": 69}, \"1kwqdds\": {\"title\": \"Best car to keep long term\", \"selftext\": \"I am looking to buy a car to keep long term (meaning keeping it till it dies). \\\\n\\\\nI do not want a SUV as the driving dynamics are extremely boring except maybe the Cupra Formentor. \\\\n\\\\nI want a car that handles well in corners, not just fast in a straight line.\\\\n\\\\nI have looked at the following cars-\\\\n\\\\nI30N sedan.

I\\\\u2019m not the best or very fast but my goal is to improve my driving and have fun in a controlled environment. I have done beginner drift days and skid pan days in the past as well as try to work on my own cars as much as possible. \\\\n\\\\nSo I\\\\u2019m writing this as a lot of people think you need a car with 500hp and every modification under the sun to do a track day. Repeat with me \\\\u201c6 pot brakes do not make you stop faster\\\\u201d and hoping to encourage more people to give it a go.\\\\n\\\\nAll you need is a cheap but RELIABLE platform with some sort of aftermarket support or be good at making stuff. Manual gearbox is a must if you have a slow car like the trusty jazz. And it\\\\u2019s heaps more fun. We bought ours at 202,000km and incomplete service history. Changed the fluids and spark plugs and that\\\\u2019s it.\\\\n\\\\nGood budget platforms can be stuff like the Jazz, Toyota Echo Sportivo, Hyundai Excel, Yaris , Swift and Swift sport , there are some euro ones if you\\\\u2019d like to take a gamble like Renault Clio etc. before you commit to a nugget I would research if you can get A) good suspension to bolt in B) easy to find brake pads.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a budget of more than $5k for just the car then you can get ratty mx5s and Civics etc for $8-10k which are a better platform to begin with but not needed.\\\\n\\\\nNow you have a Nugg\\\\u00e9t, these are the things you need to do a track day.\\\\n\\\\nTyres - Hankook RS4 should be the baseline tyre. They\\\\u2019re cheap $550 for 4 for 3 on special. RE003s and Pilot sports won\\\\u2019t cut it in the dry, you\\\\u2019ll probably overheat them. Tyres are your most important purchase , they will dictate your grip and braking performance.\\\\n\\\\nBrake pads - upgraded brake pads and OEM discs. You don\\\\u2019t need slotted or drilled. We use EBC yellow in the Jazz. Probably not the best pad for track use but we were in a time pinch and they are so far so good. Lots of people use Winmax W3 or Hawk. You\\\\u2019ll have to do some research for your own preference. \\\\n\\\\nBrake fluid - high temp brake fluid, we use Motul 600 RBF. Flush out your old fluid and put this in. Bleed the brakes. Enjoy not boiling the fluid when you brake hard after a few laps.\\\\n\\\\nFire extinguisher - Mounted on a metal bracket where the driver can reach. $40 extinguisher and bracket maybe $30-40? Free or cheap if you can make one.\\\\n\\\\nHelmet - Motorcycle helmets are usually okay but check the organisers rules. Car helmets sometimes have extra things for HANS devices. You can pick up one from $150 all the way up to $3k decide how much your head is worth. \\\\n\\\\nTyre deflator and inflator - You\\\\u2019ll want to check your tyre pressure after each session as cold and hot pressures will change a lot. I was told to aim for about 30psi hot. So I usually start the day at about 25/26psi cold and keep checking.\\\\n\\\\nWheel alignment - make sure your car is driving as it should and the suspension geometry is okay.\\\\n\\\\nAASA Motorsport day license $25 ish dollars. You need one of these to drive. You can also buy a yearly one if you plan to do more than a few events.\\\\n\\\\nThats it if you want to do it on a real budget. Make sure the car has no leaks, the brakes work, no loose items in the car and book in your first event!\\\\n\\\\nIf you enjoyed your first track day you can do more to your car! Because maybe you\\\\u2019ve been bit by the track bug.\\\\n\\\\nSeat - A racing seat will help tremendously in the corners, make sure you get reputable brand seats and high quality mounts.\\\\n\\\\nSuspension upgrades , coilovers, sway bars. Camber kits etc. This is where you can start spending money depending on how crazy you want to get.\\\\n\\\\nFor me I went with BC racing DS series with custom spring rates, basically following Honed Developments suspension recipe.

It was the sixth generation Ford Falcon and also included the Ford Fairmont (AU)\\\\u2014the luxury-oriented model range. The AU series replaced the EL Falcon and was constructed on the (at the time) new EA169 platform which continued to harbour Falcon models until 2010 when the BF wagon was discontinued, and Ford Territory models until 2011. The AU series was replaced by the updated BA series.\\\\n\\\\nThe AU series was conceived under *Project Eagle* that begun in February 1993, and gained the official codename *EA169* in October 1994. It was developed and brought to market in 1998 only after Ford Australia had given consideration to a revamped fifth generation Falcon and a fully imported replacement such as the American front-wheel drive Ford Taurus or rear-wheel drive Ford Crown Victoria, the European rear wheel-drive Scorpio and, reportedly, even the Japanese rear-wheel drive Mazda 929 (then part of the Ford conglomerate).\\\\n\\\\nThe above alternatives were eliminated in favour of a substantial redesign of the indigenous platform, due to concerns about the Australian market preference for high towing capacity, large interior size and local employment. Specific factors included, for example: research at the time indicated that 69% of Falcons were fitted with towbars and the perception that rear-wheel drive cars were better at towing; the fact that the import models had limited body style options (sedan only or sedan and wagon) and no capability to use a V8 engine.\\\\n\\\\nStylistically, this new generation Falcon sported Ford\\'s radically new global design language, labelled \\\\\"New Edge\\\\\". The aim of this design was to attract a younger generation of buyers with avant-garde looks, however, in Australia it polarized public opinion to the benefit of the more organically designed rival, the 1997 Holden Commodore (VT). The AU series had a very efficient drag coefficient of Cd=0.295 for the sedan (an 11% improvement over the preceding EL series) and 0.34 for the wagon.\\\\n\\\\nFor the first time in Falcon\\'s history, Independent Rear Suspension (IRS) became available as standard on some models and optional on others. It also featured Australian production firsts, such as Variable Cam Timing (VCT) on some 6-cylinder models and an adaptive automatic transmission on the high-performance T series with steering wheel gear shifting buttons.\\\\n\\\\nKey changes from the fifth generation Falcon included a 35 kg (77 lb) reduction in weight for the base car, 17.5 per cent stiffer bodyshell, and an eight per cent improvement in fuel consumption. Peculiarly, Ford Australia decided to use the original 1950\\'s font for the new \\\\\"Falcon\\\\\" and \\\\\"Futura\\\\\" badges.\\\\n\\\\nAs stated previously, the AU was the first Falcon to offer IRS (a double wishbone design on an isolated subframe). IRS was made available as a costly option on the base Forte, Fairmont and \\'S\\' models, and standard on Fairmont Ghia, XR6 VCT and XR8 models. The updated 6-cylinder engines incorporated advanced features such as VCT on some models and a temperature sensor in the cylinder head, which detected coolant loss and allowed the car to \\\\\"limp home\\\\\" safely by cutting cylinders. The engine range comprised: the base Intech model producing 157 kW (211 hp), with a revised cylinder head featuring smaller valve stems, larger exhaust valves, and different rocker ratio, as well as a revised piston and longer conrod and a cast aluminium cross-bolted oil sump (with the same power output as the EL series); an \\\\\"HP\\\\\" version reserved to the XR6 producing 164 kW (220 hp) (thanks to: unique cylinder head; reshaped inlet port; redesigned exhaust port; \\\\u2018open\\\\u2019 combustion chamber shape to restrict pre-detonation from hot spot areas; unique camshaft; higher fuel pressure; recalibrated EEC V engine management system); the VCT version producing 172 kW (231 hp) for the XR6 VCT; a *Windsor V8* producing 185 kW (248 hp) (also carried over from the EL series but without major upgrades).\\\\n\\\\nTransmissions were improved for better shift feel and the auto was recalibrated to better suit the upgraded engines. The six and eight cylinder models had a 4-speed BTR M93LE and M97LE automatic transmission, respectively. The automatic XR series models had an \\\\\"adaptive shift\\\\\" with five shifting strategies depending on driving conditions. The manual transmission, where available, was a 5-speed T5 model.\\\\n\\\\nThe program cost A$700 million before product launch and key staff included chief designer, Steve Park, and Marcus Hotblack, Manager of Interior Design.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, please see the following:\\\\n\\\\n[AU Falcon Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Falcon_(AU))\\\\n\\\\n[Shannons Club - Has the AU Falcon become better with age?](https://www.shannons.com.au/club/forum/general/has-the-au-falcon-become-better-with-age/)\\\\n\\\\n[Top Gearbox - Ford\\'s Unloved Child - The AU Falcon](https://www.topgearbox.com/cars/entertainment/motoringbox/172877-views%E2%80%A2sep-5-2019-5-6k-140-share-save-motoringbox-16-7k-subscribers-today-were-looking-at-one-of-the-most-infamous-cars-to-ever-come-out-of-australia-a-car-which-has-generated/)\\\\n\\\\n[Trade Unique Cars - AU Falcon Buyers Guide](https://www.tradeuniquecars.com.au/buyers-guide/2001/2000-2002-ford-falcon-au-bfii-xr8-buyers-guide)\\\\n\\\\n[Australian Car Reviews - AU Falcon Buyers Guide](http://australiancar.reviews/reviews.php#!content=guide&make=Ford&model=Falcon&gen=237)\\\\n\\\\n[ProductReview - AU Falcon Product Reviews](https://www.productreview.com.au/listings/ford-falcon-au-1998-2002)\\\\n\\\\n[CarSales - All AU Falcons for sale in Australia](https://www.carsales.com.au/cars/?q=(And.Service.carsales._.(C.Make.Ford._.(C.Model.Falcon._.(Or.Series.AU._.Series.AU+II._.Series.AU+III.))))&sort=%7ePrice)\\\\n\\\\n*I am a human, and this action was performed manually.\", \"score\": 109, \"upvote_ratio\": 0.95, \"timestamp\": 1750637023.0, \"subreddit\": \"r/CarsAustralia\", \"num_comments\": 13}, \"1ipxfq3\": {\"title\": \"Talk me out of Skoda Kodiaq Deal\", \"selftext\": \"Family with 1 kid, 1 on the way.

I think the AU Falcon is possibly the fugliest shit stain to grace Australian roads this side of a SsangYong Stavic, though I do have fond memories of my friend\\\\u2019s not-quite-so-fugly XD with its agricultural 4-speed manual and non-power assisted steering, which made trying to hurry it a physical work-out and near-death experience. I very much like a Barra swap.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve been to the odd hill-climb, rally, track day (as a spectator), and car show over the last 20 years. I\\\\u2019ve mainly owned hot hatches, including a Peugeot GTI6, Golf MK6 GTI, Renault Clio 172 Sport, Renault Megane RS265, BMW M135i (2013).\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019m comfortable doing basic maintenance myself, such as oil and filter changes, discs and pads. My step dad is a retired mechanic with a hoist in his back yard, and I\\\\u2019ve assisted with more complex jobs, like engine mounts and auxiliary belts.\\\\n\\\\nI currently own a 2013 Mazda 6 Wagon, a 2004 Subaru Forester SG9 STI and a Tesla Model 3 Long Range with the acceleration boost.\\\\n\\\\nI think Elon Musk is a bit of a dickhead. On a good day.\\\\n\\\\nBesides the Tesla, the most powerful car I\\\\u2019ve driven was my friend\\\\u2019s 2007 AMG S63. (386KW, 630NM)\\\\n\\\\nWith that context behind us, let\\\\u2019s begin.\\\\n\\\\nSo\\\\u2026 I really loved the M135i. Until the big end bearings went on the N55 with less than 100,000km. I\\\\u2019d owned it since 42,000km, always religiously maintained it, including in that time, 2 rocker cover and gasket replacements (fucking plastic rocker covers that warp and leak), radiator replacement, oil leak fixes from near turbo and oil filter, replacement charge pipe (again plastic, WTF), and the usual consumables such as brakes and tyres.\\\\n\\\\nAn engine replacement with a second hand N55 was going to cost $15K. A rebuild likely above and beyond. I think an N55 crank was alone going to be 3K, let alone rods, pistons and what ever else it needed, plus labour. (If you\\\\u2019re about to comment, \\\\u201cjusT Throw In sOme neW BeArings anD sell it\\\\u201d, you\\\\u2019re a cunt. Go fuck yourself.)\\\\n\\\\nI read people talk about the S58 being reliable\\\\u2026 Shit, maybe within warranty\\\\u2026 BMW, love your cars, but never again\\\\u2026\\\\n\\\\nAnyway, I digress\\\\u2026\\\\n\\\\nThis was during 2020, I was out of work due to COVID and sold my baby, broken, for $15K, sucked it up and found the most reliable family car I could within my budget: a 2013 Mazda 6 wagon with 65,000KM. \\\\n\\\\nMy wife loved it. Anonymous. Instantly, people acted less like dickheads, let you merge. Stopped trying to race you. We still have it.\\\\n\\\\nI still had my RS265, which was a great car. Absolutely zero issues over 3 years. French reliability. Still the best handling car I\\\\u2019ve ever driven. FWD haters have no idea. Yes, traction off the line was something to be managed, but on the road, the chassis balance was in another league.\\\\n\\\\nI took a full-time job, saved some money, and after some man maths, a few months working on my wife, we test drove a Tesla Model 3 Long Range. The instant torque, 0-100 in 4.4 seconds felt like a cheat code. People talk about 0-100 times of other cars, but forget, that\\\\u2019s with launch control. The Tesla does it all day, every day, just by pressing the pedal. Real world, there are very few cars that come close.\\\\n\\\\nI bought the car at just under $79K. The most I\\\\u2019d ever spent before was 50. It was a stretch, but $30K down and financing the rest at 1.99% over 4 years and a balloon of about $23K works out to $155 a week.\\\\n\\\\nIn the BMW and the Megane, I averaged around 12L per 100km. Must be the way I drive, but I don\\\\u2019t know why you buy a performance car if you\\\\u2019re trying to be fuel efficient. With solar, charging during the day (about $1200 to buy and install the wall connector) basically means no fuel costs, and maintenance is also just tyres, brakes, etc. So my moderate man maths calls this $3K savings a year, or $15K over 5 years, bringing the cost down to around $65K. I also feel the resale will be better than average at \\\\\\\\~$40k+. I\\\\u2019m sure you\\\\u2019ll tell me why I\\\\u2019m wrong in the comments, but considering the TCO of the BMW, I feel I\\\\u2019m ahead. \\\\ud83d\\\\ude0a\\\\n\\\\nDriving wise, it handles really well. Like *really* well. The weight is low and the steering is super direct and confidence inspiring, though not a lot of feel. The torque out of the corners is biblical. I bought the acceleration boost ($3K) the day it became available, dropping the 0-100 to 3.9 seconds. Quarter mile in 11.9. It is fucking absurdly quick. It has a 10ms torque response, meaning you have \\\\\\\\~650NM of torque at any speed delivered in 1/100th of a second. There is nothing faster you can buy bang for buck.\\\\n\\\\nTraction control with electric motors is superb. You can get a modicum of rear biased turn in on throttle (the rear *will* kick out), but no smoky burnouts, and the front also does voodoo to pull you into line.\\\\n\\\\nI hear people parrot that there\\\\u2019s \\\\u2018no soul\\\\u2019, but I suspect they haven\\\\u2019t actually driven one and are just talking out their arse. It is a fun car.\\\\n\\\\nThe one thing I hate are the seats \\\\u2013 they need more side bolstering. Also, yes, touch screens are not the best choice for all controls.\\\\n\\\\nBesides driving, what I love: the stereo is seriously excellent; the glass roof is cool, and heated seats and steering wheel are lovely in winter.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve driven it from Brisbane to Sydney, used the Tesla charger network and it was fine. About 20 to 25 minutes a stop to charge from 40% to 90% every 2 to 2.5 hours. Around town I probably get around 500km to a full charge, though only charge to 85% to preserve the life of the battery. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we\\\\u2019ve gone away for a weekend, just plugging in to a power point is enough to give you at least 200km range overnight. (3pm-9am)\\\\n\\\\nI drive from Ferny Hills to St Lucia for work, 35 mins, and it takes about 4% of the battery.\\\\n\\\\nI get that it\\\\u2019s expensive and not accessible for a lot of people, but for those for whom it may be viable, just take one for test drive. Make up your own mind.\\\\n\\\\nOh, and it absolutely spanks the AMG S63.\", \"score\": 131, \"upvote_ratio\": 0.91, \"timestamp\": 1673355481.0, \"subreddit\": \"r/CarsAustralia\", \"num_comments\": 159}, \"1izdwvd\": {\"title\": \"Jaguar warranty drama\", \"selftext\": \"I am fighting for my vehicle Jaguar E-pace 2020 to be fixed \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nIn July my vehicle had an engine light come on and the car was running at no power. Jaguar roadside assist was called & they sent out an NRMA team guy to look over the vehicle. The NRMA guy had showed us the codes that came up on this car which were a persistent\\\\n misfire & running on 3 cylinders. There was nothing NRMA could do on their end to fix the vehicle so it had to be sent to the closest dealership. The vehicle was then towed to the closest dealership\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nThe vehicle was scheduled to be assessed on the 6th of August 2024. Dealership has stated that there is a misfire & that the car was a 15K job. Dealership also stated that this issue has a bulletin that addresses how\\\\n to fix the issue. We also asked what was the needs for this job as to why is it 15K? Dealership said this was for a lot of parts that they needed to order like injectors etc.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nThis was being put through Extended warranty through Alliance. Dealership needed some extra information from myself about the service history which I happily provided. I sent in via email X2 service history invoices to be passed on to Alliance as they were needing\\\\n these to proceed with the claim. The reason my car was not serviced at a Jaguar dealership was due to living in a non-Jaguar/land rover dealership town. I had also asked the Dealership  if he could send through documentations as to what is needing to be done to this\\\\n vehicle, I never received this.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nThe claim on this vehicle was approved on the 22nd of August. Dealership stated that my car would be completed with a wait time of 2 weeks & there was a backorder of a product.  \\\\n\\\\nI didn\\\\u2019t hear back from Dealership for a little bit of time so I contacted them on the 11th of September via email following up on any updates on my vehicle. Dealership contacted back & said part is still on backorder with no ETA. They sent through description of this\\\\n part which is part number:. 10699L and a quote of $3500.80? Where this is not stated on the invoice, I will later bring up further along the line. This part was ordered on the 12th of August, a month already gone by.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nI was also receiving updates via Jaguar customer service . The only updates I was receiving were the same thing every time, parts were on backorder & there was no ETA on this part.  \\\\n\\\\nOne day jag customer service contacted me & said that they had ordered this part from 3 different countries to see which one arrived the quickest which I thought was strange. There was one that had an ETA & it was coming from Europe arriving into Melbourne on the 21st of\\\\n October 2024. These phone calls are all be recorded through Jaguar.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nWe are now in October Wednesday the 23rd 2024, i have contacted the Dealership to see if he has received this part as it was arriving on the 20th or 21st. The bloke I was dealing with stuttered abit & said it has arrived. I said great when will the process start & completion be completed?\\\\n He said that they were waiting for a hoist & car will not be completed by end of next week, this was via phone call. My father received a phone call 5 minutes after our chat & had been told that the vehicle should be done by the end of the day. I then received\\\\n via email not long after this call that he had been out the back and the vehicle was being worked on & will be completed by the end of the week.  \\\\n\\\\nTo me this all felt strange as to how it was going to be done end of next week to end of this week to now being completed the 24th of October 2024.  \\\\n\\\\nI emailed the dealership if we could pick the vehicle up on Saturday the 26th of October as we live 3 hours away & have the day off work. As their website states their opened Monday to Saturday.  \\\\n\\\\nSimon says that the service department is closed on Saturdays, so we chose to leave Friday around lunch to travel to Albury.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s Friday the 25th of October & we arrived at the Dealership around 3.30pm to pick up the vehicle. When we got the car was not ready & it took them 10 minutes to find paperwork. Meanwhile I had called up this morning to let them know I was coming to pick the\\\\n car up.  \\\\n\\\\nPaperwork was given to us & they had showed us photos of oil being found throughout the engine & stated that this has all been cleaned. They also shown us a photo of the dash with an oil light on & I noticed that they reached a speed of 130kms with an oil\\\\n light on. I will attach a photo of this.  \\\\n\\\\nMy father also states that there were no injectors replaced when they said these were one of the things being replaced from the start. He states that they didn\\'t need replacing?  I have now also noticed that the invoice is invoiced at $ 4744.50 not $15,000.\\\\n Dealership said he drove this car & it drives like a brand-new car.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nWe proceeded outside to collect the vehicle. I\\\\u2019ve noticed before jumping inside the vehicle that the number plate was being held on by a cable tie & the fuel cap was sticking out & looked unusual. I checked the fuel cap & this had been broken & there was tape\\\\n holding it together.  \\\\n\\\\nWe then went back inside to show the bloke I was dealing with as my car never left my house this way & should not be leaving the dealership like this. He comes out & asks what\\\\u2019s wrong with it when you can clearly see it\\\\u2019s bent & does not sit in properly. He also asks us how does\\\\n it normally open, you push it and it bounces out. Shouldn\\'t a jaguar worker know this? My mother says it should just pop open and he goes I know how it works, which I found rude. They knew nothing about this & tried to put it on me saying it could have\\\\n come like this, which we then said it never left our house like this. He took a photo of the issue & was going to look into it. He also states that they do not do work like this. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nI proceeded to leave the dealership & noticed the car felt unusual to drive so I swapped drivers with my father & let him drive. We drive off & an engine light comes on, car loses power & starts jerking. This almost resulted into an accident getting onto the\\\\n highway. This all happened within 5 minutes of leaving the dealership.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nWe now are on our way back to the dealership as this was unacceptable. My father told the dealership that the issue was not fixed & the dealership said I drove that car yesterday 200kms and it drove like a brand-new car. My father said get in the car and see what we are talking\\\\n about. Worker jumped in pushed the throttle all the way down revved it & said I can hear the problem and took it straight to the garage to be looked at Monday.  \\\\n\\\\nWe are now 3 hours away leaving with no fixed car after 3 months.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nThe 28th of October I received an email from the dealership that the cylinders are down on compression causing miss fire. He said the state of the engine is such that is now unserviceable and a new engine will be required.  \\\\n\\\\nDealership says I will be looking at a completed repair bill of $48,251.00. I contacted dealership  asking is this going through Alliance Warranty as this is way out of my control. Via phone call with dealership - says this will be coming out of my own pocket due to the wrong oil\\\\n being used. The wrong oil was never used.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nThere was a phone call between my father & dealership. My father says something about the fuel cap & that it needs to be fixed, worker states that the car was broken into to syphon fuel out. Meanwhile they tried to blame me for this & I never received an apology.\\\\n We also said that this was a $15,000 job & said it was, but we said how when the invoice is invoiced at $4744.50. Dealership also told us that they are being audient (being looked into). That defiantly says something\\'s dodgy with this dealership. Simon kept\\\\n refusing to put the claim through & we proceeded to contact someone higher in the Jaguar department.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nWe also asked Simon about some of the parts on the invoice & he could not explain this to us.  \\\\n\\\\nSimon had called up our mechanic and asked what oil he had used; he had told him the wrong oil due to being put on the spot and not knowing what car he was talking about. Simon proceeded to write down on the invoice of the mechanics the wrong oil & sent it\\\\n in for a claim. We contacted our mechanic & the right oil was used 0W20 & he spoke to Simon clearing this up on the right oil he used.  \\\\n\\\\nNow Simon is saying it is still not acceptable because it is not a long-life oil.  \\\\n\\\\nThe claim was not accepted.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve also spoken to someone in the warranty company & i have described to them about the oil not being correct and resulted into needing a new engine. They said that our stories are different as to why it didn\\'t get accepted. Simon is not telling me the full\\\\n story or something\\'s gone wrong with my car. \\\\n\\\\nHe couldn\\'t tell me much as this is due to being a manufacturer warranty.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nI am a 24-year-old lady, 2 weeks away from giving birth as a single mother. I am being left without a car & am still currently paying off this car. I would like for Jaguar to fix the issue as i am being treated unfairly & my car has been treated with disrespect.\\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nHow do I not know the car has resulted to this due to: \\\\n\\\\nThe car being broken into to syphon fuel out? \\\\n\\\\nWas it stolen?  \\\\n\\\\nHow did my car do 130 on the speedo with an oil light & running on 3 cylinders?  \\\\n\\\\nAlso why was the car not picked up from the start that it was running on low compression & needing a new engine?  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nWhy did Simon say this is a $15,000 job but its $4744.50?  \\\\n\\\\nWhy was this a 2-week job turned into 3 months? \\\\n\\\\nHow did the car drive smooth for them when immediately i had an engine light straight away? \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAfter all of the debacle my vehicle was sent back to Griffith via a tow truck. We then made a phone call to a different dealership as this is where the vehicle was originally purchased from. We spoke to Trent & explained the situation. Trent had told us due to the sludge\\\\n throughout the engine this could have been created due to spark plugs, solenoids a cvv which was changed. My vehicle was towed to the next dealership  & Trent had got back to us with the vehicle needing 2 solenoids changed. Trent had put this through Alliance warranty\\\\n as my vehicle has extended warranty. Alliance declined this claim & Trent tried his best to get them to approve it. Jaguar accepted this as a goodwill & Trent told us that if anything else is wrong within the extended warranty period that they will fix the\\\\n issue. I have this in email also from Trent.  \\\\n\\\\nOnce the claim was approved this only took a couple days and the vehicle was ready to be picked up. We drove to Sydney with my newborn baby who was only 4 weeks. Upon arrival Trent explained to us what was done & that the oil in the vehicle looked fine. 1st dealership\\\\n had changed the oil previous fix, but vehicle was not fixed.  \\\\n\\\\nThe vehicle was ready to be driven off. Once on the highway heading towards Newcastle way the vehicle started to slow down & stalling. Lucky my brother was on the highway & pulled up behind me as it was just myself & my baby.  \\\\n\\\\nThe vehicle was then towed away again. Jaguar refused to take this back to the 2nd dealership as this is where i wanted it to go. They said the 2nd dealership was more than 100ks from where i was when it was only around 50ks. The vehicle was taken to a 3rd dealership which is 4ks from\\\\n The 2nd dealership .  \\\\n\\\\nJaguar told me the vehicle was being taken to Northern beaches JLR. When i called northern beach, my vehicle was not there. Lucky the tow truck had told me where they took it. How did Jaguar not know where my vehicle went?  \\\\n\\\\n3rd dealership told me that my vehicle needs a service & that this could fix the issue. The vehicle did not need a service until another 200kms. Not sure how a service will fix a cylinder misfire. Then he had come back to tell me they were following a bullentin. This\\\\n is what the 1st dealership had done. I explained that this was already done & it does not need to be done again. He said they were going to send off the oil & get it tested. 1st dealership were the last to change the oil. They were horrible at getting back to me with updates.\\\\n I had to ring & they told me it needed a new engine. I asked if they sent off the oil, they said they didn\\'t need to then they told my father they looked at the oil with their eyes & there was sludge throughout the oil. They could not give me an answer to\\\\n why it needs a new engine. They said the services played a part in it. The vehicle had up to date services.  \\\\n\\\\n3rd dealership tried to put this claim through, this was knocked back by JLR. Trent from 2nd dealership in an email had advised 3rd dealership  that if alliance will not accept the claim that JLR will do as goodwill. Trent also advised JLR head office. This was all knocked back.  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nHow were the last two claims accepted but this will not be accepted? \\\\n\\\\nAlliance has advised us this vehicle has 5 year warranty with JLR.  \\\\n\\\\nMy hire vehicle was stopped being paid for from JLR & was reported stolen. No one had told me this vehicle needed to go back till after this was reported stolen.  \\\\n\\\\nWhy are they saying due to lack of servicing when they accepted last two claims with the correct servicing & never once questioned the servicing?  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nThis is unfair to me as i am a single mum, this vehicle is still being paid off. The servicing on this vehicle is up to date. I cannot afford $38,000 - $45000 for a new engine.

So defo not even worth 5K in my book and not suitable for me given I am new to Australia and the last thing I would want is to be dealing with a car that breaks down constantly and doesn\\\\u2019t get me from A to B whilst I am already stressed about the move and adjusting to a new country. I did feel that it was fishy that the dealer didn\\\\u2019t want me to get the keys to open the hood and he just went inside leaving me outside so I didn\\\\u2019t get a proper look at the car but even then I am not a car person and given the dealer wasn\\\\u2019t very forthcoming about the cosmetic damage (I don\\\\u2019t mind cosmetic damage but the fact that the car\\\\u2019s condition didn\\\\u2019t match the description on car sales website was a big red flag for me). Dealer kept going on and on about how good condition the car is in and that he has already had the car inspected and the mechanic has given it the OK (I didn\\\\u2019t ask him for the official report or similar but even then I didn\\\\u2019t trust him and that maybe the mechanic will also get a commission if this car gets sold to me). He asked me to make a decision quickly because there two more people wanting to buy the car and he is only holding because I came first. I get a PPI which cost around $300 and they declared the car possibly unroadworthy even! \\\\n\\\\nWhat else can I do to avoid buying a car I might regret? The $300s are gonna add up and I am looking at another car now so need to be very selective which cars I want a mechanic to inspect. I can inspect myself for obvious faults and the behavior of the dealer for red flags so that I spend the 300$s more wisely and also that if it is too cheap, there is something more to it \", \"score\": 4, \"upvote_ratio\": 0.83, \"timestamp\": 1744714350.0, \"subreddit\": \"r/CarsAustralia\", \"num_comments\": 34}, \"1irgpo0\": {\"title\": \"Modern classics to use as a daily.\", \"selftext\": \"Hello, me and my family are emigrating to Australia from the UK this year and I am looking for the perfect modern classic to use as a daily. \\\\nThis category of cars is that they are new enough to be comfortable and reliable.

We drove the car and really liked it, we noticed the car had some scuffs in the interior but he said the car will be fully detailed before pickup. We were also told by him that we will be given a full orientation of the car and its functions once we come and pick it up.\\\\n\\\\nThen another person came in to assist us, I am assuming is the sales advisor, we negotiated on the car and it was initially listed around $34k and when we checked the car it\\'s at $32.5k. We were able to negotiate a deal at $31.4k (could probably do better but I\\'m bad a negotiating). Dealer said they were a large group and is a \\\\\"fixed price\\\\\" car dealer, meaning they included detailing, a full tank of gas, and 3 months rego as part of the sale. I am paying the full amount so I didn\\'t take any finance with the dealer.\\\\n\\\\nNow the bad part begins,   \\\\nonce we picked up the car, we noticed that the interior of the car had more scuffs and marks that were not there previously, there was a smidge of white mark (possibly paint) in the leather seat and a drop of white paint on the side of the driver seat. I do think this is due to the detailing process. We complained to the sales advisor and all we got was he tried to vacuum it and will give us a cleaning product recommendation.\\\\n\\\\nAt this point, my partner and I were already disappointed and didn\\'t know what to do as this was our first car and making this decision has been difficult for us. \\\\n\\\\nComes the part where we take the picture beside the car, the sales advisor took the pictures from his phone and it took 3 days just to get a picture sent to my email and multiple text reminders. Once I have signed all the legal documents, he hurried us out of the building and into the car, there was no promise of car introductions and all, it was all a lie.\\\\n\\\\nThe tipping point for me to write up this post:  \\\\nHad an email notification saying that the car is successfully transferred under my name but I need to renew my rego as it is expiring in 3 weeks. I was puzzled and furious to learn that the rego has not been renewed by them. I gave the sales advisor a call and he said due to an issue in the system, they were unable to do it for us due to it being near the end of FY, so instead they need me to do it myself and they will reimburse it.\\\\n\\\\nNext thing I did was I wrote him an email to confirm that they will reimburse before I make such payments. I have yet to hear back from him as it has only been a few hours but we both were severely disappointed by the service and the false promises that were made.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding the car itself, did a mini road trip for the weekend and thankfully no issues whatsoever.

None mention the diesel issues. A VERY quick google doesn\\\\u2019t reveal any problems (though a later detailed search after purchase would). Wife finds a Mazda 6 wagon 2015 she likes, refuses to entertain the idea of a SUV and wants a wagon like its still the 90s. \\\\n\\\\nJan 2023 - We test drive the car, it drives well. We check to see if the pram fits in the boot. it does easily. The seller knows we are soon to have a kid. Initially have trouble with finance (plan is to buy the 6 under finance then sell the Impreza to pay off the loan). We argue with the bank that the car isn\\\\u2019t THAT old and is a Mazda, it is reliable (Ironic). They agree and finance the car. $19k later we own a Mazda 6 wagon.\\\\n\\\\nLate Jan - We pick up the car that weekend. Probably do 300-400km in it. First sign of trouble is the car stalls whilst driving after its been idling a while. Restart, and it stalls again. Restart, and its totally fine. Take it to the mechanic. He spends a week on it, no codes. No errors. No sign of fault. Can\\\\u2019t replicate. \\\\n\\\\nFeb \\\\u2013 Car is fine\\\\n\\\\nMarch \\\\u2013 Car dash lights up light a Christmas tree on the way home from having the baby seat installed (again, ironic), dash says pull over and don\\\\u2019t drive. Tow track to the mechanic. Mechanic is surprised to see the car given it was serviced the previous week. Turns out something (suspect a rat) has chewed the drive belt which cut the alternator. Easy fix. But sets the tone for what\\\\u2019s to come: more bad luck.\\\\n\\\\nLate March \\\\u2013 The car is running rough. Really rough. I say to the wife \\\\u201cI think this thing is going to stall\\\\u201d as I stop at a corner, indicating to turn. I was right. It dies. I restart, and dead. Restart: Dead. Restart: dead. We sit there for a minute, blocking traffic when finally on the 8th or 9th attempt, the car restarts. I limp it home and immediately rip out the baby seat and install it in the Impreza, thanking whatever gods exist that I haven\\\\u2019t yet sold it. The 6 drive perfectly fine to the mechanic who spends the next month working on it.  I contact previous owner who claims to have no knowledge. I contact the mazda dealer it was purchased from, no history of a similar fault. \\\\n\\\\nApril \\\\u2013 Mechanic cant fault it. Cant replicate the fault after putting 100s of Ks on it (with our permission). Eventually, the car wont start one morning, flat battery. Mechanic replaces the battery and says \\\\u201cHopefully a faulty battery? Let us know how you go\\\\u201d. I refuse to let my son in the car. I suggest we sell the 6 whilst its running. Wife refuses, it is her car I can\\\\u2019t force her.\\\\n\\\\nJune \\\\u2013 No sign of problems. We consider selling the Impreza. Wife was driving the 6 comes home and reluctantly admits the car emitted a weird thump and was struggling to change gear, numerous warning lights. Back the mechanic. Code about turbo pressure. Clear code, cant replicate fault. Again recommend we sell the car. Again, shot down. Mechanic recommends taking it direct to Mazda. Car goes to local Mazda dealer who describe it as of a \\\\u201cproblematic era\\\\u201d. They spend a month and can\\\\u2019t replicate the fault. They replace a carbon sensor under an extended warranty. Mazda claim the car is fixed.\\\\n\\\\nJuly/August: Occasionally idling or starting a little rough, but no faults. Baby seat goes back in the Mazda, I was right: The Impreza was too small. \\\\n\\\\nSeptember: Car struggles to get up to speed when pulling onto freeway. Acts as if the accelerator is being mashed wildly, complete lack of power. Car dies 10km latter at 100km an hour on the freeway with kid in the back seat. But restarts no problems. Taken straight to Mazda. Tell the wife she can either sell the Mazda or she can take over dealing with it, but I nor kid won\\\\u2019t get in that car ever again. Wife agrees (reluctantly) to sell. \\\\n\\\\nMazda spend the next couple of weeks trying to replicate, eventually they do. Detected as a fuel pressure problem. They request ok to spend 2.5k to remove fuel system and test. We see no choice, only other option is to sell to a wrecker for bugger all. Fuel system test completed, no faults. Car still stalling. Mazda start slowly replacing fuel system parts one by one and testing to see if the car still faults. Suggest again to Mazda to hook up a multimeter to the fuel pump. Surprise! It\\\\u2019s a solenoid in the fuel pump starving the car of diesel. Mazda spend the next couple of weeks ordering replacements. They do this work for free, but still charge us the $2.5k for the fuel tests, that didn\\\\u2019t detect a fault even though it WAS in the fuel system.\\\\n\\\\nSell the Impreza to clear the debt, sell the Mazda for $11k to a business (couldn\\\\u2019t in good faith sell it privately in case another family got screwed). Told the wife we\\\\u2019re getting a new SUV with a warranty to stop this happening again, sold my baby (not the actual one, the Impreza) to fix this mess so its my call, she agrees cause she is over it too. Go out and order a Kia Sportage which is what we probably should have done in the first place.\\\\n\\\\nTLDR: People love Mazda, but when push comes to shove I\\'d argue they don\\\\u2019t know their cars as well as you\\\\u2019d hope. It took them 2 goes and several months to fix it. And even then I sold it before I found out if it was truly fixed at a decent loss. The 6 was a great car, I understand why the wife struggle to want to sell it.

I pretty much want to buy a car that would a last a considerable amount of years (pretty much to death lol). If it helps, I am a male in my 20s and on my full license. I am just looking for a car for myself instead of sharing the family car. Problem is, I commute to the city so I\\'d want something cheap to use on the weekends and/or to take me to the station.  \\\\nTo add: I wouldn\\'t mind learning how to tinker and maintain these cars to improve reliability or to add features such as an upgraded head unit. Wouldn\\'t mind learning to drive manual either, if that\\'s even feasible in Sydney (traffic sucks ass).\\\\n\\\\nTo narrow the options: Japanese is preferred for reliability and parts but I wouldn\\'t mind Korean. I like hatches the most due to their size but I wouldn\\'t mind a smaller sedan or a coupe. Leaning towards a hot/warm hatch or coupe, more \\\\\"fun\\\\\". Budget is about 10-15k but can squeeze if need be.\\\\n\\\\nOption 1: Toyota Corolla. These cars are very popular for a reason, but people mark these up like mad. From what I\\'ve heard they are boring to drive and look boring too. Probably not worth learning to tinker around with either.\\\\n\\\\nOption 2: Honda Civic. Arguably better looking and cheaper or similar priced than Corollas. However, I don\\'t see much hatches of these on the market, unless going for the newer models. Probably fun to mod, customise and learn on. The Gen 10s look very nice too in my unpopular opinion.\\\\n\\\\nOption 3: Accord Euro. I see this being brought up a lot on here and they look nice inside & out and are spacious. Not sure how reliable and fuel efficient this is compared to a Corolla or a Civic.\\\\n\\\\nOption 4: Toyota 86. Best looking of the bunch and probably the best feeling of the bunch. The car nuts I know are pretty much telling me to get this. Would be really fun to drive on the weekends, but probably not worth as a daily drive down to the station (not sure if safe either). Most expensive of this list too.\\\\n\\\\nOption 5: Suzuki Swift (sport). Fun looking car to zip around and learn manual with. Heard the sports have turbo in them. Only cons I can think of is I\\'m unsure of its reliability and fuel economy compared to a Corolla or a Civic.\\\\n\\\\nI would appreciate the advice and guidance as I am very overwhelmed and cannot decide with all these choices.

I had an NA Mx5 as my weekend toy at the time. However all these cars were like 10-15 years old and still commanding $20-25k with potential dodgy mods and spotty history. \\\\n\\\\nSo I thought fuck it I can get a new car for not much more. The other contender was the Hyundai i20N  but unfortunately they were not taking orders and I think a bit too much car for my needs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2014\\\\u2014-\\\\n\\\\nThe Good\\\\n\\\\nAlmost Faultless. Nothing has gone wrong. It\\\\u2019s always fun to drive , sometimes tiring driving a small car around a sea of SUVs and Dual cabs who think big cars = right of way. \\\\n\\\\nApart from that it\\\\u2019s great. It\\\\u2019s easy to drive, the clutch is light and easy to use even in heavy traffic. It handles great , corners like crazy. Very zippy around town for city driving and sufficient enough power for country roads. It would be nice if it had 10/20 more HP but that can be fixed with a tune.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s a little bit faster than the brochure suggests official figures say 137hp but when dynod it\\\\u2019s a little closer to 150. Really good low down torque for traffic lights, you won\\\\u2019t win any drag races but at 970kg ish it\\\\u2019s a really engaging drive. \\\\n\\\\nI ended up selling the MX5 because I found myself driving the swift a lot more and it\\\\u2019s a lot more hassle free.\\\\n\\\\nWith wider wheels and sticky tyres, coilovers, Michelin pilot sport 5 and a few mods , exhaust , Blow off valve etc and a slightly heavy foot it still gets 7.4L/100km.

It works , but sometimes is temperamental connecting. Having to have a wired connection in 2024 is shite.\\\\n\\\\nI wish turn in was a little sharper and the wheel had more feedback. I\\\\u2019m not a fan of the electric power steering feeling.\\\\n\\\\nGearbox is a bit vague compared to an mx5, rarely happens but sometimes hard to find 3rd / 4th gear at higher RPM.

I recently purchased a used car from a dealer I saw lots of commercials for regarding pre approvals, $0 down, etc. I was looking for something reliable as my current vehicle was old with lots of miles. I make an appointment with this dealer and ended up not going. They kept calling and finally I made another appointment. I was just going to look. I get there, test drive a few and fell in love with a 21 ford edge. After 4 hours in the dealership the car is mine. I made a small down payment & got my terms. The interest rate is insanely high, but I plan to refinance with my bank. Fast forward 3 days, a check engine light comes on. I notice the car is running rough. I call the dealership ( they have a 5 day return policy ) and they were very rude, unprofessional and tell me to \\\\u201c call my warranty \\\\u201c. So I did. Warranty tells me an in network shop I can go to and I have a $0 deductible for 30 days. I take it here and the shop gets it done in 1 day. Turns out it needed a purge valve. Cool. I pick it up and start driving it again. I notice the car had a weird noise when I would start the vehicle the entire time I\\\\u2019ve had it, but after some research I brushed it off as the high pressure fuel pump. I was convinced there was an issue with the fuel indicator as the levels were dropping rather quickly. So I keep driving the car as normal and the cold start noise kept getting progressively worse. It was an awful sound. I took multiple videos. So I decide I\\\\u2019m going to take the car to the same shop it went to the first time. I had a list of concerns for them. Such as the cold start noise, lots of hesitation on acceleration, the auto start stop half ass works and the fuel levels. They call me the next day and tell me they cannot figure out what\\\\u2019s wrong and they\\\\u2019re not able to fix the vehicle. Great. I call my warranty company and turns out they found another shop not too far from that one and I could take it there. I call the shop, the guy is super friendly & I bring the car there. When I drop it off I give him the same list of concerns I had from the beginning. He\\\\u2019s very attentive and seems to really care about his job. He called me the next day and told me they figured out the issue. Turns out there is a camshaft noise in cylinder 2 and the ENTIRE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I am shocked. I haven\\\\u2019t even had this vehicle for a month. He also informed me the fuel pump will need replacement as well. His next step was waiting on a parts quote so he could get that over to the warranty company. Later in the day he said he got the quote back and he had to submit that as well as a video to the warranty company & they had to do a parts comparison. He said the company may provide an engine or he will get it. I will know next Tuesday if the company is going to cover this issue. Now all that being said I am furious. The first car I have ever purchased and it\\\\u2019s been in the shop 3 times. Some family has told me I should take legal action regarding the \\\\u201c Lemon Law \\\\u201c in my state.

Am I crazy to think that I\\\\u2019ll find one at a reasonable price or should I just bite the bullet and buy something at a higher price?\\\\n\\\\nNotes: I really want to stay in that price range, I am not replacing my car by choice and I can\\\\u2019t really afford a payment. Small body damage doesn\\\\u2019t bother me, as long as the price drops correspondingly. I try to research every car I look at before doing a test drive, so I find these numbers and can go to the dealership armed with them. I\\\\u2019ve also been told to try to stick to bigger dealerships, bc they are more likely to have good cars (the prior owners having traded in for a new model by choice, rather than selling their used car as a last resort to a small dealership)\", \"score\": 3, \"upvote_ratio\": 0.81, \"timestamp\": 1736534422.0, \"subreddit\": \"r/UsedCars\", \"num_comments\": 24}, \"1k3upyv\": {\"title\": \"Tips for buying a used truck off FB marketplace\", \"selftext\": \"Like the title says.

I\\\\u2019ve been in Canada for about 3 years now and I\\\\u2019ve reached a point where I really need a car. It\\\\u2019s becoming harder to manage without one and I feel stuck. The problem is I\\\\u2019m not sure if I should finance a new car or buy a used one with cash. I want to make a smart decision but the options are overwhelming.\\\\n\\\\nRight now I work only 2 days a week, so my income isn\\\\u2019t very stable. My girlfriend works full-time and makes around $70,000 a year. We plan to get a car together and if we finance it, we will be splitting the payments 50/50. The car we are considering is the 2025 Hyundai Elantra Preferred with Tech, which comes to around $33,000 after taxes. That would mean a payment of around $211 every 2 weeks.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, we could go the cash route. We can afford to spend up to $8,000 if we decide not to finance. But finding a decent used car in Ontario, especially around Brampton, has been really hard. A lot of the listings seem shady, with people tampering with mileage or hiding issues. We don\\\\u2019t have a car right now, so even going to check out used cars is a struggle since we have to rely on public transit or Uber. I also like tech and a nice interior in a car, and that\\\\u2019s really hard to find in older vehicles within our budget.\\\\n\\\\nUsed car prices are also really high. I\\\\u2019ve seen some cars from 2008 or 2009 with over 300,000 kilometers still going for $6,000 or $7,000. It just doesn\\\\u2019t feel like a good deal sometimes.\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\\\u2019m torn. Should we go ahead with financing and at least get something reliable and new, even if it means being stuck in payments for years? Or is it better to avoid debt and try our luck with a used car, even though the market feels unreliable?\\\\n\\\\nIf we do buy used, what cars under $8,000 are actually worth it and still offer some decent comfort and tech? Also, why is it so hard to find a good used car in Ontario right now?\\\\n\\\\nAny advice or personal experience would really help.

At first glance this looked quite appealing, for an 11 year old car. This peaked my interest. However the thoughts started to creep in as to why such an old car had such little mileage? Accident, bad tune, poor maintenance, garage queen etc.\\\\n\\\\nI did some digging managed to find one dealership that had actually serviced the car twice before. The following information was provided to me:\\\\n\\\\n* 2016: Car serviced with about 10 000km (6200 miles) mileage\\\\n* 2017: Aftermarket software had been installed on the car\\\\n* 2019: car serviced with about 37 000km (22 900 miles) mileage\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately they did not have any more information and couldn\\'t say whether those were the only services the car has, and in South Africa due to privacy laws, no-one else can provide me with any other information. The hopeful boy inside me was thinking this might have just been someone\\'s weekend garage queen for 11 years.\\\\n\\\\nI proceeded to do some more digging and got a car vertical report, which checks out, nothing out of the ordinary or worrying on that. In South Africa there is a vehicle analysis (best word i could think of) company that performs an analysis on used cars condition before they are sold and provides a rating + report on the cars condition (Called Dekra). If you read online reviews about Dekra, its not the best, however its better that nothing. The Dekra report for this car looked pretty good, no issues and most of the car was in really good condition.\\\\n\\\\nGoing through the photos you can see the previous owner definitely did some mods. There\\'s a carbon eventuri intake as well as some beyern wheel. Hard to tell what else is under the hood, but I wouldn\\'t be suprised if there was more too it. Interior looks clean and well maintained as well as the exterior etc.\\\\n\\\\nLong story short, as any sensible person would do, I wanted to get the internets opinion on the car. Its not all the facts, but most of the important ones. This is the first car I would be buying with my own money, and I\\'ve never owned a modified car before.
